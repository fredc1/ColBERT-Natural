<P> According to Cajori , A History of Mathematical Notations , Johann Rahn used both the therefore and because signs to mean `` therefore '' ; in the German edition of Teutsche Algebra ( 1659 ) the therefore sign was prevalent with the modern meaning , but in the 1668 English edition Rahn used the because sign more often to mean `` therefore '' . Other authors in the eighteenth century also used three dots in a triangle shape to signify `` therefore , '' but as with Rahn , there was n't much in the way of consistency as to how the triangle was oriented ; because with its current meaning appears to have originated in the nineteenth century . In this century , the three - dot notation for therefore became very rare in continental Europe , but it remains popular in the British Isles . </P>

Here is a question: who wrote the song photograph by ringo starr


Here is some context wikipedia that may or may not be relevant
<P> The lyrics are a reflection on lost love , whereby a photograph is the only reminder of the protagonists ' shared past . Starr and Harrison began writing the song in the South of France in 1971 , during a period when Starr was focused on developing his acting career . They first recorded `` Photograph '' late the following year , along with the single 's B - side , `` Down and Out '' , during sessions for Harrison 's Living in the Material World album ( 1973 ) . The officially released version was recorded in Los Angeles with producer Richard Perry , and it incorporates aspects of Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound through the presence of multiple drums and acoustic guitars , as well as an orchestra and a choir . Aside from Starr and Harrison , the musicians on the recording include Nicky Hopkins , Bobby Keys , Jim Keltner , and Spector 's musical arranger , Jack Nitzsche . Starr made a promotional film for the single , shot at his and wife Maureen Starkey 's home , Tittenhurst Park . </P>
<P> `` Photograph '' has appeared on Starr 's compilation albums Blast from Your Past ( 1975 ) and Photograph : The Very Best of Ringo Starr ( 2007 ) , and live versions have featured on releases recorded with his All - Starr Band and with the Roundheads . In November 2002 , a year after Harrison 's death , Starr sang `` Photograph '' at the Concert for George -- a performance that was an emotional highpoint of the event . Engelbert Humperdinck , Camper Van Beethoven , Cilla Black and Adam Sandler are among the artists who have covered the song . </P>
<P> Ex-Beatles Ringo Starr and George Harrison began writing `` Photograph '' on a luxury yacht in the South of France in May 1971 . Starr had hired a yacht , the Marala , for the duration of the Cannes Film Festival , after attending Mick Jagger 's wedding in St Tropez with his wife , Maureen Starkey . The Starkeys were then joined in France by Harrison and the latter 's wife , Pattie Boyd , for the Monaco Grand Prix . This period coincided with Starr 's first success as a solo artist , with the Harrison - produced single `` It Do n't Come Easy '' , although he would continue to focus on his career as a film actor , beginning with a role in Blindman ( 1971 ) . </P>
<P> Another guest on the Marala was Cilla Black , singer and a friend to the Beatles since the 1960s , who recalls Starr and Harrison playing `` Photograph '' during an evening get - together , with `` everyone on board '' contributing ideas for the lyrics . As with Starr 's two singles over 1971 -- 72 , `` It Do n't Come Easy '' and `` Back Off Boogaloo '' , Harrison helped write the melody , although `` Photograph '' would mark the first time that he was credited as a co-writer with Starr . In her autobiography , Step Inside Love , Black says she had hoped to record the song for a single later in 1971 , only to be told by Starr : `` No , it 's too bloody good for you . I 'm having it myself . '' </P>
<P> The lyric to `` Photograph '' is centred around lost love , with the singer having only a single picture by which to remember his absent lover . The eponymous photograph reminds him of their former happiness together , while also enforcing the reality that `` you 're not coming back any more '' . Author Ian Inglis comments on the familiar subject matter in the conventions of pop songwriting , but identifies an `` unusual '' aspect in the lyrics ' `` absence of any hope that love might be rekindled '' . Starr expresses resignation at what the future holds , in the lines `` Now you 're expecting me to live without you / But that 's not something that I 'm looking forward to '' . </P>
<P> Musically , the song is in the key of E , with what Inglis terms an `` easy melody '' that allows for Starr 's limitations as a singer . Harrison 's `` distinctive composing style '' is particularly evident , according to authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler , and Starr would later say of Harrison 's role in their collaborations over this period : `` I only know three chords and he 'd stick four more in , and they 'd all think I was a genius . '' </P>
<P> Starr continued to pursue his film career until the end of 1972 , while also participating in musical projects such as Harrison 's Concert for Bangladesh . Late that year , Starr and Harrison recorded an early version of `` Photograph '' during the sessions for Harrison 's Living in the Material World album ( 1973 ) . With Harrison producing , this recording took place at either Apple Studio in central London , or Harrison 's home studio , FPSHOT , in Oxfordshire . </P>
<P> Starr re-recorded the song in March 1973 , while working at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles on Ringo , his first solo album in the rock or contemporary pop style . He later described Ringo as an `` accidental album '' , since it only came about because he was attending the Grammy Awards in Nashville , where The Concert for Bangladesh won the Grammy for Best Album of 1972 . Keen to find another activity to justify the flight to the US , Starr arranged to record with American producer Richard Perry during the visit . </P>
<P> The recording engineer on `` Photograph '' was Bill Schnee , and author Simon Leng suggests that Harrison helped `` hew '' the production . Along with Starr ( on drums ) and Harrison ( 12 - string acoustic guitar ) , the other musicians included Nicky Hopkins ( piano ) , Klaus Voormann ( bass ) and Jim Keltner ( drums ) , all of whom had participated in the sessions for Material World . In addition , Vini Poncia , Starr 's new songwriting partner , and session musician Jimmy Calvert played acoustic rhythm guitar on the Los Angeles recording . </P>
<P> Overdubs on the basic tracks recorded for Ringo took place from April to July 1973 . On `` Photograph '' , the additional instrumentation included a saxophone solo by Bobby Keys and percussion played by one of Harrison 's Apple Records signings , brothers Lon and Derrek Van Eaton . Harrison added harmony and backing vocals , supporting Starr 's lead vocal part . </P>
<P> Jack Nitzsche , Phil Spector 's musical arranger for much of the 1960s , provided the song 's string and choral arrangements , which were overdubbed at Burbank Studios on 29 June . Aside from Nitzsche 's contributions , the recording incorporates aspects of Spector 's Wall of Sound production through the use of multiple rhythm guitars and drums , and prominent percussion such as castanets . Leng draws parallels between the `` resonant arrangement '' on `` Photograph '' and the production that Harrison adopted for Ravi Shankar 's song `` I Am Missing You '' , an April 1973 recording that also featured Starr . </P>
<P> With `` Photograph '' selected as the album 's lead single , Starr chose `` Down and Out '' , a song written by him alone , for the B - side . Starr recorded the song in England , backed by Harrison , pianist Gary Wright and Voormann . The Harrison - produced session most likely took place in 1972 , according to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter , during the same period as Starr and Harrison 's first attempt at recording `` Photograph '' . </P>
<P> A twelve - bar blues with what Starr biographer Alan Clayson describes as `` perfunctory '' lyrics , the recording features solos from Harrison , on slide guitar , and Wright . Perry subsequently added a horn section , resulting in him being credited as co-producer on the track . Carr and Tyler dismiss `` Down and Out '' with the description : `` a very mundane throwaway tune only saved from extinction by the professional arrangement and by Harrison 's distinctive slide - guitar solo '' . </P>
<P> Apple Records released `` Photograph '' , backed by `` Down and Out '' , on 24 September 1973 in America , and on 19 October in Britain . Starr made a promotional film for `` Photograph '' , in which he mimed to the song while walking through the grounds of Tittenhurst Park , the Berkshire estate that he had recently purchased from former bandmate John Lennon . To circumvent the BBC 's ban on lip - synching , Starr placed his hand over his mouth for part of the song , thereby making it impossible to tell whether he was singing or merely miming . The single 's picture sleeve consisted of a photo by Barry Feinstein that showed Starr 's head poking through a large star made of silver foil . The same image , which author Bruce Spizer terms `` the Ringo starfish '' , appeared on the single 's face labels and on those of the Ringo album . </P>
<P> The album 's release followed in November 1973 , with `` Photograph '' appearing as the third track , preceding another Harrison contribution , `` Sunshine Life for Me ( Sail Away Raymond ) '' . Opposite the printed lyrics for `` Photograph '' inside the album booklet , a lithograph by Voormann depicted a framed picture on a shelf or desktop , in which Starr looks dejectedly at a framed picture of a woman . In his personal life at this point , the album 's arrival coincided with the failure of Starr 's marriage , partly as a result of Harrison and Maureen conducting an affair . While the friendship between the two former bandmates soon recovered , Starr and Harrison would not officially write another song together after `` Photograph '' . </P>
<P> Noting the context in which Starr 's song of `` beautiful sadness '' was released in the United States , Clayson describes `` Photograph '' as having been a popular request on radio playlists `` for a nation still awaiting the return of many of its sons from Vietnam , following the January cease - fire '' . Rodriguez comments on the precipitous timing of the single , which `` capitaliz ( ed ) on the year 's nostalgia craze '' , while news of Starr recording with each of his former bandmates during the Ringo sessions provided further impetus . In late November , the single topped America 's Billboard Hot 100 for one week , Starr 's first number 1 hit on that chart as a solo artist and Harrison 's third there as a composer since the Beatles ' break - up in 1970 . `` Photograph '' was also number 1 in Canada and Australia , while in Britain it peaked at number 8 . In Rodriguez 's words , the single `` did a good job of setting the table '' for Ringo , which also enjoyed considerable commercial success . On 28 December 1973 , `` Photograph '' was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America , signifying US sales of 1 million -- Starr 's second such award , after `` It Do n't Come Easy '' . </P>
<P> On release , Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone highlighted `` Photograph '' as one of the album 's `` three most wonderful songs '' , along with the Lennon - composed `` I 'm the Greatest '' and the Harrison -- Mal Evans collaboration `` You and Me ( Babe ) '' . Gerson noted how the song 's intro provided an effective `` pull on the listener '' and wrote that , while the lyrics had a sorrowful quality , `` the effect is warming '' . Billboard 's album reviewer praised Perry 's `` stunning production '' on `` the best Ringo album ever '' , adding : `` We all know already that ' Photograph ' has got to be a No. 1 single this month , right ? '' </P>
<P> Although less impressed with Ringo , Alan Betrock wrote in Phonograph Record : `` It 's also clear when you reach ' Photograph ' that Side One is the undisputed champ of the album . Jack Nitzsche has thrown in a lot of his past influences here , including the Famous School of Phil Spector castanets , lesson No. 2 . '' Betrock concluded of the song : `` ' Photograph ' is one of those rare pop records that grows stronger with each play , and will be covered and revived for years to come ( I 'll lay you 50 - 1 it appears on the next Andy Williams album ) . '' </P>
<P> Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considers `` Photograph '' a `` gorgeous collaboration '' between Starr and Harrison , a track that `` ranks ... among the very best post-Beatles songs by any of the Fab Four '' . Robert Rodriguez describes it as `` an elegantly produced ballad '' and Starr 's `` signature tune as a solo artist '' . Rodriguez continues : `` The ersatz Wall of Sound somehow managed not to swamp the lead vocal and Harrison harmony , while embodying the best qualities of the Beatles ' singles : hummable and familiar , yet fresh and enduring . '' In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever , Nicholas Schaffner wrote of how the song 's `` grand , sweeping arrangement '' was reminiscent of Harrison 's `` own recent cosmic productions '' . Author Elliot Huntley similarly acknowledges the extent of Harrison 's influence on this and other tracks on Ringo while rueing that `` Photograph '' marks the only formal co-composition by the two ex-Beatles . Huntley describes the song as the album 's `` stand - out track '' and `` by a country mile , the commercial high - point '' for Starr as a songwriter . Former Mojo editor Mat Snow recognises it as `` perhaps the single best song of ( Starr 's ) career '' and the `` emotional heart '' of the album . </P>
<P> The song provided the title to Starr 's 2007 career - spanning compilation Photograph : The Very Best of Ringo Starr , having earlier appeared on Blast from Your Past ( 1975 ) , a greatest - hits collection covering his years on Apple Records . For the 1991 CD reissue of Ringo , the album was expanded through the inclusion of three bonus tracks , the last of which was the long - unavailable `` Down and Out '' . In 2009 , `` Photograph '' was featured in the Judd Apatow - directed film Funny People and appeared on the accompanying soundtrack album . </P>
<P> Following his return to touring in July 1989 -- the first tour for Starr since the Beatles quit performing live in 1966 -- he has played `` Photograph '' regularly with the various incarnations of his All - Starr Band . Eschewing his drum kit for the role of lead singer , Starr often closed his shows with the song ( before returning for an encore ) during tours he made between 1989 and 2000 . A live version appeared on the album and video Ringo Starr and His All - Starr Band ( 1990 ) ; recorded at the Greek Theatre , Los Angeles , on 3 September 1989 , it features the original All - Starr line - up of Starr , Billy Preston , Jim Keltner , Rick Danko , Levon Helm , Dr. John , Joe Walsh , Nils Lofgren and Clarence Clemons . </P>
<P> Starr also included the song in his performances on the television shows VH1 Storytellers , in May 1998 , and PBS 's Soundstage , in August 2005 . Featuring backing from the Roundheads -- a band led by his latter - day producer Mark Hudson -- these recordings were issued on Starr 's releases VH1 Storytellers ( 1998 ) and Ringo Starr : Live at Soundstage ( 2007 ) , respectively . Further versions with his All - Starr Band have appeared on the albums King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Ringo & His New All - Starr Band ( 2002 ) , Ringo Starr & His All Starr Band Live 2006 ( 2008 ) and Live at the Greek Theatre 2008 ( 2010 ) , the latter with Gary Wright among the revised line - up . Starr re-recorded the song with the American band Vandaveer for his 2017 album Give More Love . </P>
<P> On 29 November 2002 , Starr performed `` Photograph '' at the Concert for George , held at London 's Royal Albert Hall to mark the first anniversary of Harrison 's death . According to the Concert for George website : `` Ringo Starr caught everyone with a tear in their eye with a rendition of ' Photograph ' , a composition he wrote with George , which seemed to sum up how everyone felt . '' </P>
<P> Starr 's appearance came towards the end of the concert , and Inglis writes that his arrival was `` given an extra poignancy by his choice of song '' . In his preamble to the audience , Starr stated , `` I loved George , George loved me '' , before mentioning that `` Photograph '' had taken on a new meaning with the passing of Harrison . This performance -- with a large band that included Jeff Lynne , Eric Clapton , Dhani Harrison , Preston , Keltner and saxophonist Jim Horn -- was issued on the Concert for George album ( 2003 ) and appears in David Leland 's documentary film of the event . In a July 2003 interview , Starr discussed his recently released tribute song to Harrison , `` Never Without You '' , while acknowledging that he remained closest to Harrison out of all the former Beatles following the band 's break - up . </P>
<P> Starr sang `` Photograph '' at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards , during which he and Paul McCartney , as the two surviving ex-Beatles , were honoured with the Recording Academy 's Lifetime Achievement Award . The event took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on 26 January 2014 . Rolling Stone reported on Starr 's performance of the song : `` Backed by a massive full band , he bounced around the stage while old black - and - white photographs showed on a big screen behind him . '' The accompanying images were taken from Starr 's recently published book ; also titled Photograph , it consists of photos from his personal collection , dating back to the 1950s and ' 60s . </P>
<P> Engelbert Humperdinck and the Ray Conniff Singers each released recordings of the song in 1974 . The following year , London - based recording engineer David Hentschel covered `` Photograph '' , along with all the other tracks on Ringo , for his album Sta * rtling Music . The latter , an experimental work featuring Hentschel on ARP synthesizer , was the first release on Starr 's short - lived record label , Ring O ' Records . </P>
<P> A cover version of the song by American alt rock band Camper Van Beethoven appeared on their 1993 rarities compilation Camper Vantiquities . Canadian band Sloan made mention of `` Photograph '' in their 1996 single `` The Lines You Amend '' , the lyrics of which refer to a song `` ... about photographs / Sung by Ringo Starr / Especially in the chorus part / You always said , ' Now do n't you start ' . '' </P>
<P> Cilla Black eventually recorded `` Photograph '' , for her 2003 album Beginnings : Greatest Hits & New Songs -- a version that `` she jumps into head first at her most soulful '' , according to music critic Bruce Eder . While Starr 's original recording appeared on the soundtrack to Funny People , a cover by the film 's leading actor , Adam Sandler , is available as an iTunes bonus track with the album . </P>

<P> `` Photograph '' is a song by English musician Ringo Starr that was released as the lead single from his 1973 album Ringo . Starr co-wrote the song with George Harrison , his former bandmate from the Beatles . Although the two of them collaborated on other compositions , it is the only song officially credited to the pair . A signature tune for Starr as a solo artist , `` Photograph '' became an international hit , topping singles charts in the United States , Canada and Australia , and receiving gold disc certification for US sales of 1 million . Music critics have similarly received the song favourably ; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considers it to be `` among the very best post-Beatles songs by any of the Fab Four '' . </P>

Here is a question: who is playing the halftime show at super bowl 2016

<P> Coldplay , Rihanna , and Katy Perry were considered as potential acts for the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show in 2015 . Perry was soon confirmed as the headliner of the halftime show in October 2014 . In late November , 2015 , reports surfaced stating that multiple acts would perform during the halftime show . Coldplay was confirmed as the lead half time performer for Super Bowl 50 on December 3 , 2015 , one day before the release of their seventh studio album A Head Full of Dreams . It was confirmed that Beyoncé and Bruno Mars would join Coldplay as special guests . Chris Martin called Mars to ask him to perform with Coldplay ; however , Mars declined the offer . Nevertheless , the singer of Coldplay invited Mars to his studio in Malibu where he was working . There , Martin revealed to Mars that he wanted for him to perform `` Uptown Funk '' with Beyonce . Despite this , Mars still did n't think it was a good idea and asked the former to talk to Beyonce to see what was her opinion on that . Martin videotaped him and Mars , while the former sang a song to Beyoncé so that she would come to do the Super Bowl with both of them . Beyonce response was receptive to the idea . </P>
<P> At that time , Mars and Beyoncé were both doing a diet and stressing out . One day before the performance they were `` watching playback backstage '' , while Beyonce ate a bag of Cheetos . Mars asked her `` That 's what you 're doing ? '' , to which she replied `` There 's nothing more we can do these last two days . It 's gon na be what it 's gon na be . So I 'm gon na enjoy this bag of Cheetos . '' Mars strongly believes that Beyoncé is `` coming for you every single time . So you better bring your A-game every time . '' </P>
<P> The show opened with Chris Martin singing the opening chorus from `` Yellow '' . He was then joined by the remaining band members of Coldplay to perform `` Viva la Vida '' , `` Paradise '' , and `` Adventure of a Lifetime '' with the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles conducted by Gustavo Dudamel and the University of California Marching Band . Bruno Mars , Mark Ronson , and a troupe of backing dancers ( dressed in the style of Michael Jackson ) then performed `` Uptown Funk '' . Beyoncé , also in a Jackson - inspired outfit and appearing with a set of backing dancers dressed as Black Panthers , then performed her new single `` Formation '' in a mass choreographed dance number before joining Mars onstage for a verse of `` Uptown Funk '' . Coldplay played a snippet of `` Clocks '' during a video montage of past Super Bowl halftime and national anthem performances , including those by Bruce Springsteen , Missy Elliott , Katy Perry , The Rolling Stones , Paul McCartney , Stevie Wonder , Diana Ross , James Brown , Whitney Houston , Michael Jackson , The Black Eyed Peas , U2 , Prince , Beyoncé and Mars . The show concluded with the band performing `` Fix You '' and `` Up&Up '' with Beyoncé , Mars and everyone taking part in the show . At the end of the performance , the audience participated in a card - stunt creating a rainbow and the phrase , `` Believe in love '' , the closing lyrics to Coldplay 's A Head Full of Dreams . </P>
<P> The performance received generally mixed review from critics , who complimented Beyoncé and Mars ' part of the performance but were critical of Coldplay . Jon Caramanica of The New York Times stated that Coldplay `` acted more as a stagehand than an actual performer '' while Beyoncé 's section of the performance was `` the night 's true event '' . Caramanica also noted that Beyoncé and Mars `` outsang '' Martin during the closing part of the performance . Andrew Barker of Variety similarly noted that `` Coldplay seemed resigned to politely allowing themselves to be played right off their own stage '' by the `` far flashier '' Mars and Beyoncé . In a review for Fox Sports , Chris Chase panned Coldplay 's performance , calling it `` inexplicable , indecipherable , and unnecessary '' and a `` musical snooze '' . Chase complimented Beyoncé 's and Mars ' appearances but described the performance as `` boring '' . Alex Needham of The Guardian gave the performance four stars , saying that `` Queen Bey at the height of her powers effortlessly overwhelmed Coldplay 's widescreen anthems in a show that seemed lightweight until she showed up '' . </P>
<P> Robert Bianco of USA Today stated that Martin `` seemed overwhelmed '' by the size of the event , and that despite being a `` personable and energetic performer '' , an `` awful lot '' of Martin 's energy `` went into jumping '' . Bianco praised Beyoncé 's appearance and stated that she `` stole the show '' . Wendy Geller of Yahoo ! also complimented Beyoncé 's and Mars ' appearances , but criticized the montage of previous halftime performances , describing it as `` confusing rather than touching '' and stating that the performance was `` definitely a cold play '' . </P>
<P> Following the performance , Beyoncé was criticized for performing a song that they considered to be `` anti-police '' during the halftime show and for appearing to align herself with the Black Lives Matter movement . Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani accused the performance of being anti-police and also criticized Beyoncé 's use of Black Power and Black Panther Party symbolism in her dance routine . `` This is football , not Hollywood , and I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers who are the people who protect her and protect us , and keep us alive , '' he said . The controversy caused a `` # BoycottBeyonce '' hashtag on Twitter and protesters announced plans for an `` anti-Beyoncé '' rally on the morning of February 16 outside of the NFL 's headquarters in New York City , but no one showed up for such a rally . CNN political commentator Sally Kohn stated that `` too many police continue to show themselves to be far more interested in reactionary defensiveness and preserving the abusive status quo . '' Black Lives Matter activist Melina Abdullah praised Beyoncé and other artists who `` are willing to raise social consciousness and use their artistry to advance social justice . '' </P>
<P> The halftime show became the fourth highest ever watched show in the United States , with total viewership of 115.5 million . </P>

<P> The Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show took place on February 7 , 2016 , at Levi 's Stadium in Santa Clara , California as part of Super Bowl 50 . It was headlined by the British rock group Coldplay with special guest performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars , who previously had headlined the Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII halftime shows , respectively . </P>

Here is a question: where is most distortion found on a globe


Here is some context wikipedia that may or may not be relevant
<P> A globe shows details of its subject . A terrestrial globe shows land masses and water bodies . It might show nations and prominent cities and the network of latitude and longitude lines . Some have raised relief to show mountains . A celestial globe shows stars , and may also show positions of other prominent astronomical objects . Typically it will also divide the celestial sphere up into constellations . </P>
<P> The word `` globe '' comes from the Latin word globus , meaning `` sphere '' . Globes have a long history . The first known mention of a globe is from Strabo , describing the Globe of Crates from about 150 BC . The oldest surviving terrestrial globe is the Erdapfel , wrought by Martin Behaim in 1492 . The oldest surviving celestial globe sits atop the Farnese Atlas , carved in the 2nd century Roman Empire . </P>
<P> The circumference of the Earth is quite close to 40 million metres . Many globes are made with a circumference of one metre , so they are models of the Earth at a scale of 1 : 40 million . In imperial units , many globes are made with a diameter of one foot , yielding a circumference of 3.14 feet and a scale of 1 : 41,777,000 . Globes are also made in many other sizes . </P>
<P> Sometimes a globe has surface texture showing topography ; in these , elevations are exaggerated , otherwise they would be hardly visible . Most modern globes are also imprinted with parallels and meridians , so that one can tell the approximate coordinates of a specific place . Globes may also show the boundaries of countries and their names , a feature that can quickly become out of date , as countries change their name or borders . </P>
<P> Many terrestrial globes have one celestial feature marked on them : a diagram called the analemma , which shows the apparent motion of the Sun in the sky during a year . </P>
<P> Globes generally show north at the top , but many globes allow the axis to be swiveled so that southern portions can be viewed conveniently . This capability also permits exploring the earth from different orientations to help counter the north - up bias caused by conventional map presentation . </P>
<P> Celestial globes show the apparent positions of the stars in the sky . They omit the Sun , Moon and planets because the positions of these bodies vary relative to those of the stars , but the ecliptic , along which the Sun moves , is indicated . </P>
<P> The sphericity of the Earth was established by Greek astronomy in the 3rd century BC , and the earliest terrestrial globe appeared from that period . The earliest known example is the one constructed by Crates of Mallus in Cilicia ( now Çukurova in modern - day Turkey ) , in the mid-2nd century BC . </P>
<P> No terrestrial globes from Antiquity or the Middle Ages have survived . An example of a surviving celestial globe is part of a Hellenistic sculpture , called the Farnese Atlas , surviving in a 2nd - century AD Roman copy in the Naples Archaeological Museum , Italy . </P>
<P> Early terrestrial globes depicting the entirety of the Old World were constructed in the Islamic world . According to David Woodward , one such example was the terrestrial globe introduced to Beijing by the Persian astronomer , Jamal ad - Din , in 1267 . </P>
<P> The earliest extant terrestrial globe was made in 1492 by Martin Behaim ( 1459 -- 1537 ) with help from the painter Georg Glockendon . Behaim was a German mapmaker , navigator , and merchant . Working in Nuremberg , Germany , he called his globe the `` Nürnberg Terrestrial Globe . '' It is now known as the Erdapfel . Before constructing the globe , Behaim had traveled extensively . He sojourned in Lisbon from 1480 , developing commercial interests and mingling with explorers and scientists . In 1485 -- 1486 , he sailed with Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão to the coast of West Africa . He began to construct his globe after his return to Nürnberg in 1490 . </P>
<P> Another early globe , the Hunt -- Lenox Globe , ca . 1510 , is thought to be the source of the phrase Hic Sunt Dracones , or `` Here be dragons '' . A similar grapefruit - sized globe made from two halves of an ostrich egg was found in 2012 and is believed to date from 1504 . It may be the oldest globe to show the New World . Stefaan Missine , who analyzed the globe for the Washington Map Society journal Portolan , said it was `` part of an important European collection for decades . '' After a year of research in which he consulted many experts , Missine concluded the Hunt -- Lenox Globe was a copper cast of the egg globe . </P>
<P> A facsimile globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemueller in 1507 . Another `` remarkably modern - looking '' terrestrial globe of the Earth was constructed by Taqi al - Din at the Istanbul observatory of Taqi al - Din during the 1570s . </P>
<P> The world 's first seamless celestial globe was built by Mughal scientists under the patronage of Jahangir . </P>
<P> Globus IMP , electro - mechanical devices including five - inch globes have been used in Soviet and Russian spacecraft from 1961 to 2002 as navigation instruments . In 2001 , the TMA version of the Soyuz spacecraft replaced this instrument with a virtual globe . </P>
<P> In the 1800s small pocket globes ( less than 3 inches ) were status symbols for gentlemen and educational toys for rich children . </P>
<P> Traditionally , globes were manufactured by gluing a printed paper map onto a sphere , often made from wood . </P>
<P> The most common type has long , thin gores ( strips ) of paper that narrow to a point at the poles , small disks cover over the inevitable irregularities at these points . The more gores there are , the less stretching and crumpling is required to make the paper map fit the sphere . </P>
<P> Modern globes are often made from thermoplastic . Flat , plastic disks are printed with a distorted map of one of the Earth 's Hemispheres . This is placed in a machine which molds the disk into a hemispherical shape . The hemisphere is united with its opposite counterpart to form a complete globe . </P>

<P> Dominance in genetics is a relationship between alleles of one gene , in which the effect on phenotype of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same locus . The first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive . For genes on an autosome ( any chromosome other than a sex chromosome ) , the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive . Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics . Often the dominant allele codes for a functional protein whereas the recessive allele does not . </P>
<P> A classic example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape in peas . Peas may be round , associated with allele R or wrinkled , associated with allele r . In this case , three combinations of alleles ( genotypes ) are possible : RR , Rr , and rr . The RR individuals have round peas and the rr individuals have wrinkled peas . In Rr individuals the R allele masks the presence of the r allele , so these individuals also have round peas . Thus , allele R is dominant to allele r , and allele r is recessive to allele R . This use of upper case letters for dominant alleles and lower case ones for recessive alleles is a widely followed convention . </P>
<P> More generally , where a gene exists in two allelic versions ( designated A and a ) , three combinations of alleles are possible : AA , Aa , and aa . If AA and aa individuals ( homozygotes ) show different forms of some trait ( phenotypes ) , and Aa individuals ( heterozygotes ) show the same phenotype as AA individuals , then allele A is said to dominate , be dominant to or show dominance to allele a , and a is said to be recessive to A . </P>
<P> Dominance is not inherent to either an allele or its phenotype . It is a relationship between two alleles of a gene and their associated phenotypes ; one allele can be dominant over a second allele , recessive to a third allele , and codominant to a fourth . Also , an allele may be dominant for a particular aspect of phenotype but not for other aspects influenced by the same gene . Dominance differs from epistasis , a relationship in which an allele of one gene affects the expression of another allele at a different gene . </P>
<P> The concept of dominance was introduced by Gregor Johann Mendel . Though Mendel , `` The Father of Genetics '' , first used the term in the 1860s , it was not widely known until the early twentieth century . Mendel observed that , for a variety of traits of garden peas having to do with the appearance of seeds , seed pods , and plants , there were two discrete phenotypes , such as round versus wrinkled seeds , yellow versus green seeds , red versus white flowers or tall versus short plants . When bred separately , the plants always produced the same phenotypes , generation after generation . However , when lines with different phenotypes were crossed ( interbred ) , one and only one of the parental phenotypes showed up in the offspring ( green , or round , or red , or tall ) . However , when these hybrid plants were crossed , the offspring plants showed the two original phenotypes , in a characteristic 3 : 1 ratio , the more common phenotype being that of the parental hybrid plants . Mendel reasoned that each parent in the first cross was a homozygote for different alleles ( one parent AA and the other parent aa ) , that each contributed one allele to the offspring , with the result that all of these hybrids were heterozygotes ( Aa ) , and that one of the two alleles in the hybrid cross dominated expression of the other : A masked a . The final cross between two heterozygotes ( Aa X Aa ) would produce AA , Aa , and aa offspring in a 1 : 2 : 1 genotype ratio with the first two classes showing the ( A ) phenotype , and the last showing the ( a ) phenotype , thereby producing the 3 : 1 phenotype ratio . </P>
<P> Mendel did not use the terms gene , allele , phenotype , genotype , homozygote , and heterozygote , all of which were introduced later . He did introduce the notation of capital and lowercase letters for dominant and recessive alleles , respectively , still in use today . </P>
<P> Most animals and some plants have paired chromosomes , and are described as diploid . They have two versions of each chromosome , one contributed by the mother 's ovum , and the other by the father 's sperm , known as gametes , described as haploid , and created through meiosis . These gametes then fuse during fertilization during sexual reproduction , into a new single cell zygote , which divides multiple times , resulting in a new organism with the same number of pairs of chromosomes in each ( non-gamete ) cell as its parents . </P>
<P> Each chromosome of a matching ( homologous ) pair is structurally similar to the other , and has a very similar DNA sequence ( loci , singular locus ) . The DNA in each chromosome functions as a series of discrete genes that influence various traits . Thus , each gene also has a corresponding homologue , which may exist in different versions called alleles . The alleles at the same locus on the two homologous chromosomes may be identical or different . </P>
<P> Blood types in humans is determined by a gene that creates an A , B , AB or O blood type and is located in the long arm of chromosome nine . There are three different alleles that could be present at this locus , but only two can be present in any individual , one inherited from their mother and one from their father . </P>
<P> If two alleles of a given gene are identical , the organism is called a homozygote and is said to be homozygous with respect to that gene ; if instead the two alleles are different , the organism is a heterozygote and is heterozygous . The genetic makeup of an organism , either at a single locus or over all its genes collectively , is called its genotype . The genotype of an organism directly and indirectly affects its molecular , physical , and other traits , which individually or collectively are called its phenotype . At heterozygous gene loci , the two alleles interact to produce the phenotype . </P>
<P> In complete dominance , the effect of one allele in a heterozygous genotype completely masks the effect of the other . The allele that masks the other is said to be dominant to the latter , and the allele that is masked is said to be recessive to the former . Complete dominance , therefore , means that the phenotype of the heterozygote is indistinguishable from that of the dominant homozygote . </P>
<P> A classic example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape ( pea shape ) in peas . Peas may be round ( associated with allele R ) or wrinkled ( associated with allele r ) . In this case , three combinations of alleles ( genotypes ) are possible : RR and rr are homozygous and Rr is heterozygous . The RR individuals have round peas and the rr individuals have wrinkled peas . In Rr individuals the R allele masks the presence of the r allele , so these individuals also have round peas . Thus , allele R is completely dominant to allele r , and allele r is recessive to allele R . </P>
<P> Incomplete dominance ( also called partial dominance , semi-dominance or intermediate inheritance ) occurs when the phenotype of the heterozygous genotype is distinct from and often intermediate to the phenotypes of the homozygous genotypes . For example , the snapdragon flower color is homozygous for either red or white . When the red homozygous flower is paired with the white homozygous flower , the result yields a pink snapdragon flower . The pink snapdragon is the result of incomplete dominance . A similar type of incomplete dominance is found in the four o'clock plant wherein pink color is produced when true - bred parents of white and red flowers are crossed . In quantitative genetics , where phenotypes are measured and treated numerically , if a heterozygote 's phenotype is exactly between ( numerically ) that of the two homozygotes , the phenotype is said to exhibit no dominance at all , i.e. dominance exists only when the heterozygote 's phenotype measure lies closer to one homozygote than the other . </P>
<P> When plants of the F generation are self - pollinated , the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the F generation will be 1 : 2 : 1 ( Red : Pink : White ) . </P>
<P> See partial dominance hypothesis . </P>
<P> Co-dominance occurs when the contributions of both alleles are visible in the phenotype . </P>
<P> For example , in the ABO blood group system , chemical modifications to a glycoprotein ( the H antigen ) on the surfaces of blood cells are controlled by three alleles , two of which are co-dominant to each other ( I , I ) and dominant over the recessive i at the ABO locus . The I and I alleles produce different modifications . The enzyme coded for by I adds an N - acetylgalactosamine to the membrane - bound H antigen . The I enzyme adds a galactose . The i allele produces no modification . Thus I and I alleles are each dominant to i ( I I and I i individuals both have type A blood , and I I and I i individuals both have type B blood , but I I individuals have both modifications on their blood cells and thus have type AB blood , so the I and I alleles are said to be co-dominant ) . </P>
<P> Another example occurs at the locus for the Beta - globin component of hemoglobin , where the three molecular phenotypes of Hb / Hb , Hb / Hb , and Hb / Hb are all distinguishable by protein electrophoresis . ( The medical condition produced by the heterozygous genotype is called sickle - cell trait and is a milder condition distinguishable from sickle - cell anemia , thus the alleles show incomplete dominance with respect to anemia , see above ) . For most gene loci at the molecular level , both alleles are expressed co-dominantly , because both are transcribed into RNA . </P>
<P> Co-dominance , where allelic products co-exist in the phenotype , is different from incomplete dominance , where the quantitative interaction of allele products produces an intermediate phenotype . For example , in co-dominance , a red homozygous flower and a white homozygous flower will produce offspring that have red and white spots . When plants of the F1 generation are self - pollinated , the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the F2 generation will be 1 : 2 : 1 ( Red : Spotted : White ) . These ratios are the same as those for incomplete dominance . Again , note that this classical terminology is inappropriate -- in reality such cases should not be said to exhibit dominance at all . </P>
<P> While it is often convenient to talk about a recessive allele or a dominant trait , dominance is not inherent to either an allele or its phenotype . Dominance is a relationship between two alleles of a gene and their associated phenotypes . A `` dominant '' allele is dominant to a particular allele of the same gene that can be inferred from the context , but it may be recessive to a third allele , and codominant to a fourth . Similarly , a `` recessive '' trait is a trait associated with a particular recessive allele implied by the context , but that same trait may occur in a different context where it is due to some other gene and a dominant allele . </P>
<P> Dominance is unrelated to the nature of the phenotype itself , that is , whether it is regarded as `` normal '' or `` abnormal , '' `` standard '' or `` nonstandard , '' `` healthy '' or `` diseased , '' `` stronger '' or `` weaker , '' or more or less extreme . A dominant or recessive allele may account for any of these trait types . </P>
<P> Dominance does not determine whether an allele is deleterious , neutral or advantageous . However , selection must operate on genes indirectly through phenotypes , and dominance affects the exposure of alleles in phenotypes , and hence the rate of change in allele frequencies under selection . Deleterious recessive alleles may persist in a population at low frequencies , with most copies carried in heterozygotes , at no cost to those individuals . These rare recessives are the basis for many hereditary genetic disorders . </P>
<P> In genetics , symbols began as algebraic placeholders . When one allele is dominant to another , the oldest convention is to symbolize the dominant allele with a capital letter . The recessive allele is assigned the same letter in lower case . In the pea example , once the dominance relationship between the two alleles is known , it is possible to designate the dominant allele that produces a round shape by a capital - letter symbol R , and the recessive allele that produces a wrinkled shape by a lower - case symbol r . The homozygous dominant , heterozygous , and homozygous recessive genotypes are then written RR , Rr , and rr , respectively . It would also be possible to designate the two alleles as W and w , and the three genotypes WW , Ww , and ww , the first two of which produced round peas and the third wrinkled peas . Note that the choice of `` R '' or `` W '' as the symbol for the dominant allele does not pre-judge whether the allele causing the `` round '' or `` wrinkled '' phenotype when homozygous is the dominant one . </P>
<P> A gene may have several alleles . Each allele is symbolized by the locus symbol followed by a unique superscript . In many species , the most common allele in the wild population is designated the wild type allele . It is symbolized with a + character as a superscript . Other alleles are dominant or recessive to the wild type allele . For recessive alleles , the locus symbol is in lower case letters . For alleles with any degree of dominance to the wild type allele , the first letter of the locus symbol is in upper case . For example , here are some of the alleles at the a locus of the laboratory mouse , Mus musculus : A , dominant yellow ; a , wild type ; and a , black and tan . The a allele is recessive to the wild type allele , and the A allele is codominant to the wild type allele . The A allele is also codominant to the a allele , but showing that relationship is beyond the limits of the rules for mouse genetic nomenclature . </P>
<P> Rules of genetic nomenclature have evolved as genetics has become more complex . Committees have standardized the rules for some species , but not for all . Rules for one species may differ somewhat from the rules for a different species . </P>
<P> Although any individual of a diploid organism has at most two different alleles at any one locus ( barring aneuploidies ) , most genes exist in a large number of allelic versions in the population as a whole . If the alleles have different effects on the phenotype , sometimes their dominance interactions with each other can be described as a series . </P>
<P> For example , coat color in domestic cats is affected by a series of alleles of the TYR gene ( which encodes the enzyme tyrosinase ) . The alleles C , c , c , and c ( full colour , Burmese , Siamese , and albino , respectively ) produce different levels of pigment and hence different levels of colour dilution . The C allele ( full colour ) is completely dominant over the last three and the c allele ( albino ) is completely recessive to the first three . </P>
<P> In humans and other mammal species , sex is determined by two sex chromosomes called the X chromosome and the Y chromosome . Human females are typically XX ; males are typically XY . The remaining pairs of chromosome are found in both sexes and are called autosomes ; genetic traits due to loci on these chromosomes are described as autosomal , and may be dominant or recessive . Genetic traits on the X and Y chromosomes are called sex - linked , because they are linked to sex chromosomes , not because they are characteristic of one sex or the other . In practice , the term almost always refers to X-linked traits and a great many such traits ( such as red - green colour vision deficiency ) are not affected by sex . Females have two copies of every gene locus found on the X chromosome , just as for the autosomes , and the same dominance relationships apply . Males however have only one copy of each X chromosome gene locus , and are described as hemizygous for these genes . The Y chromosome is much smaller than the X , and contains a much smaller set of genes , including , but not limited to , those that influence ' maleness ' , such as the SRY gene for testis determining factor . Dominance rules for sex - linked gene loci are determined by their behavior in the female : because the male has only one allele ( except in the case of certain types of Y chromosome aneuploidy ) , that allele is always expressed regardless of whether it is dominant or recessive . </P>
<P> Epistasis ( `` epi + stasis = to sit on top '' ) is an interaction between alleles at two different gene loci that affect a single trait , which may sometimes resemble a dominance interaction between two different alleles at the same locus . Epistasis modifies the characteristic 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio expected for two non-epistatic genes . For two loci , 14 classes of epistatic interactions are recognized . As an example of recessive epistasis , one gene locus may determine whether a flower pigment is yellow ( AA or Aa ) or green ( aa ) , while another locus determines whether the pigment is produced ( BB or Bb ) or not ( bb ) . In a bb plant , the flowers will be white , irrespective of the genotype of the other locus as AA , Aa , or aa . The bb combination is not dominant to the A allele : rather , the B gene shows recessive epistasis to the A gene , because the B locus when homozygous for the recessive allele ( bb ) suppresses phenotypic expression of the A locus . In a cross between two AaBb plants , this produces a characteristic 9 : 3 : 4 ratio , in this case of yellow : green : white flowers . </P>
<P> In dominant epistasis , one gene locus may determine yellow or green pigment as in the previous example : AA and Aa are yellow , and aa are green . A second locus determines whether a pigment precursor is produced ( dd ) or not ( DD or Dd ) . Here , in a DD or Dd plant , the flowers will be colorless irrespective of the genotype at the A locus , because of the epistatic effect of the dominant D allele . Thus , in a cross between two AaDd plants , 3 / 4 of the plants will be colorless , and the yellow and green phenotypes are expressed only in dd plants . This produces a characteristic 12 : 3 : 1 ratio of white : yellow : green plants . </P>
<P> Supplementary epistasis occurs when two loci affect the same phenotype . For example , if pigment color is produced by CC or Cc but not cc , and by DD or Dd but not dd , then pigment is not produced in any genotypic combination with either cc or dd . That is , both loci must have at least one dominant allele to produce the phenotype . This produces a characteristic 9 : 7 ratio of pigmented to unpigmented plants . Complementary epistasis in contrast produces an unpigmented plant if and only if the genotype is cc and dd , and the characteristic ratio is 15 : 1 between pigmented and unpigmented plants . </P>
<P> Classical genetics considered epistatic interactions between two genes at a time . It is now evident from molecular genetics that all gene loci are involved in complex interactions with many other genes ( e.g. , metabolic pathways may involve scores of genes ) , and that this creates epistatic interactions that are much more complex than the classic two - locus models . </P>
<P> The frequency of the heterozygous state ( which is the carrier state for a recessive trait ) can be estimated using the Hardy - Weinberg formula : p 2 + 2 p q + q 2 = 1 ( \ displaystyle p ^ ( 2 ) + 2pq + q ^ ( 2 ) = 1 ) </P>
<P> This formula applies to a gene with exactly two alleles and relates the frequencies of those alleles in a large population to the frequencies of their three genotypes in that population . </P>
<P> For example , if p is the frequency of allele A , and q is the frequency of allele a then the terms p , 2pq , and q are the frequencies of the genotypes AA , Aa and aa respectively . Since the gene has only two alleles , all alleles must be either A or a and p + q = 1 . Now , if A is completely dominant to a then the frequency of the carrier genotype Aa can not be directly observed ( since it has the same traits as the homozygous genotype AA ) , however it can be estimated from the frequency of the recessive trait in the population , since this is the same as that of the homozygous genotype aa . i.e. the individual allele frequencies can be estimated : q = √ f ( aa ) , p = 1 − q , and from those the frequency of the carrier genotype can be derived : f ( Aa ) = 2pq . </P>
<P> This formula relies on a number of assumptions and an accurate estimate of the frequency of the recessive trait . In general , any real - world situation will deviate from these assumptions to some degree , introducing corresponding inaccuracies into the estimate . If the recessive trait is rare , then it will be hard to estimate its frequency accurately , as a very large sample size will be needed . </P>
<P> The property of `` dominant '' is sometimes confused with the concept of advantageous and the property of `` recessive '' is sometimes confused with the concept of deleterious , but the phenomena are distinct . Dominance describes the phenotype of heterozygotes with regard to the phenotypes of the homozygotes and without respect to the degree to which different phenotypes may be beneficial or deleterious . Since many genetic disease alleles are recessive and because the word dominance has a positive connotation , the assumption that the dominant phenotype is superior with respect to fitness is often made . This is not assured however ; as discussed below while most genetic disease alleles are deleterious and recessive , not all genetic diseases are recessive . </P>
<P> Nevertheless , this confusion has been pervasive throughout the history of genetics and persists to this day . Addressing this confusion was one of the prime motivations for the publication of the Hardy - Weinberg principle . </P>
<P> The molecular basis of dominance was unknown to Mendel . It is now understood that a gene locus includes a long series ( hundreds to thousands ) of bases or nucleotides of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) at a particular point on a chromosome . The central dogma of molecular biology states that `` DNA makes RNA makes protein '' , that is , that DNA is transcribed to make an RNA copy , and RNA is translated to make a protein . In this process , different alleles at a locus may or may not be transcribed , and if transcribed may be translated to slightly different versions of the same protein ( called isoforms ) . Proteins often function as enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions in the cell , which directly or indirectly produce phenotypes . In any diploid organism , the DNA sequences of the two alleles present at any gene locus may be identical ( homozygous ) or different ( heterozygous ) . Even if the gene locus is heterozygous at the level of the DNA sequence , the proteins made by each allele may be identical . In the absence of any difference between the protein products , neither allele can be said to be dominant ( see co-dominance , above ) . Even if the two protein products are slightly different ( allozymes ) , it is likely that they produce the same phenotype with respect to enzyme action , and again neither allele can be said to be dominant . </P>
<P> Dominance typically occurs when one of the two alleles is non-functional at the molecular level , that is , it is not transcribed or else does not produce a functional protein product . This can be the result of a mutation that alters the DNA sequence of the allele . An organism homozygous for the non-functional allele will generally show a distinctive phenotype , due to the absence of the protein product . For example , in humans and other organisms , the unpigmented skin of the albino phenotype results when an individual is homozygous for an allele that encodes a non-functional version of an enzyme needed to produce the skin pigment melanin . It is important to understand that it is not the lack of function that allows the allele to be described as recessive : this is the interaction with the alternative allele in the heterozygote . Three general types of interaction are possible : </P>
<Ol> <Li> In the typical case , the single functional allele makes sufficient protein to produce a phenotype identical to that of the homozygote : this is called haplosufficiency . For example , suppose the standard amount of enzyme produced in the functional homozygote is 100 % , with the two functional alleles contributing 50 % each . The single functional allele in the heterozygote produces 50 % of the standard amount of enzyme , which is sufficient to produce the standard phenotype . If the heterozygote and the functional - allele homozygote have identical phenotypes , the functional allele is dominant to the non-functional allele . This occurs at the albino gene locus : the heterozygote produces sufficient enzyme to convert the pigment precursor to melanin , and the individual has standard pigmentation . </Li> <Li> Less commonly , the presence of a single functional allele gives a phenotype that is not normal but less severe than that of the non-functional homozygote . This occurs when the functional allele is not haplo - sufficient . The terms haplo - insufficiency and incomplete dominance are typically applied to these cases . The intermediate interaction occurs where the heterozygous genotype produces a phenotype intermediate between the two homozygotes . Depending on which of the two homozygotes the heterozygote most resembles , one allele is said to show incomplete dominance over the other . For example , in humans the Hb gene locus is responsible for the Beta - chain protein ( HBB ) that is one of the two globin proteins that make up the blood pigment hemoglobin Many people are homozygous for an allele called Hb ; some persons carry an alternative allele called Hb , either as homozygotes or heterozygotes . The hemoglobin molecules of Hb / Hb homozygotes undergo a change in shape that distorts the morphology of the red blood cells , and causes a severe , life - threatening form of anemia called sickle - cell anemia . Persons heterozygous Hb / Hb for this allele have a much less severe form of anemia called sickle - cell trait . Because the disease phenotype of Hb / Hb heterozygotes is more similar to but not identical to the Hb / Hb homozygote , the Hb allele is said to be incompletely dominant to the Hb allele . </Li> <Li> Rarely , a single functional allele in the heterozygote may produce insufficient gene product for any function of the gene , and the phenotype resembles that of the homozygote for the non-functional allele . This complete haploinsufficiency is very unusual . In these cases the non-functional allele would be said to be dominant to the functional allele . This situation may occur when the non-functional allele produces a defective protein that interferes with the proper function of the protein produced by the standard allele . The presence of the defective protein `` dominates '' the standard protein , and the disease phenotype of the heterozygote more closely resembles that of the homozygote for two defective alleles . Note that the term dominant is often incorrectly applied to defective alleles whose homozygous phenotype has not been examined , but which cause a distinct phenotype when heterozygous with the normal allele . This phenomenon occurs in a number of trinucleotide repeat diseases : for an example and more details see Huntington Disease . </Li> </Ol>
<P> Many proteins are normally active in the form of a multimer , an aggregate of multiple copies of the same protein , otherwise known as a homomultimeric protein or homooligomeric protein . In fact , a majority of the 83,000 different enzymes from 9800 different organisms in the BRENDA Enzyme Database represent homooligomers . When the wild - type version of the protein is present along with a mutant version , a mixed multimer can be formed . A mutation that leads to a mutant protein that disrupts the activity of the wild - type protein in the multimer is a dominant - negative mutation . </P>
<P> A dominant - negative mutation may arise in a human somatic cell and provide a proliferative advantage to the mutant cell , leading to its clonal expansion . For instance , a dominant - negative mutation in a gene necessary for the normal process of programmed cell death ( Apoptosis ) in response to DNA damage can make the cell resistant to apoptosis . This will allow proliferation of the clone even when excessive DNA damage is present . Such dominant - negative mutations occur in the tumor suppressor gene p53 . The P53 wild - type protein is normally present as a four - protein multimer ( oligotetramer ) . Dominant - negative p53 mutations occur in a number of different types of cancer and pre-cancerous lesions ( e.g. brain tumors , breast cancer , oral pre-cancerous lesions and oral cancer ) . </P>
<P> Dominant - negative mutations also occur in other tumor suppressor genes . For instance two dominant - negative germ line mutations were identified in the Ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) gene which increases susceptibility to breast cancer . Dominant negative mutations of the transcription factor C / EBPα can cause acute myeloid leukemia . Inherited dominant negative mutations can also increase the risk of diseases other than cancer . Dominant - negative mutations in Peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( PPARγ ) are associated with severe insulin resistance , diabetes mellitus and hypertension . </P>
<P> Dominant - negative mutations have also been described in organisms other than humans . In fact , the first study reporting a mutant protein inhibiting the normal function of a wild - type protein in a mixed multimer was with the bacteriophage T4 tail fiber protein GP37 . Mutations that produce a truncated protein rather than a full - length mutant protein seem to have the strongest dominant - negative effect in the studies of P53 , ATM , C / EBPα , and bacteriophage T4 GP37 . </P>
<P> In humans , many genetic traits or diseases are classified simply as `` dominant '' or `` recessive '' . Especially with so - called recessive diseases , which are indeed a factor of recessive genes , but can oversimplify the underlying molecular basis and lead to misunderstanding of the nature of dominance . For example , the recessive genetic disease phenylketonuria ( PKU ) results from any of a large number ( > 60 ) of alleles at the gene locus for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . Many of these alleles produce little or no PAH , as a result of which the substrate phenylalanine ( Phe ) and its metabolic byproducts accumulate in the central nervous system and can cause severe intellectual disability if untreated . </P>
<P> The genotypes and phenotypic consequences of interactions among three alleles are shown in the following table : </P>
<Table> <Tr> <Th> Genotype </Th> <Th> PAH activity </Th> <Th> ( Phe ) conc </Th> <Th> PKU ? </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> AA </Td> <Td> 100 % </Td> <Td> 60 uM </Td> <Td> No </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> AB </Td> <Td> 30 % </Td> <Td> 120 uM </Td> <Td> No </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> CC </Td> <Td> 5 % </Td> <Td> 200 ~ 300 uM </Td> <Td> Hyperphenylalaninemia </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> BB </Td> <Td> 0.3 % </Td> <Td> 600 ~ 2400 uM </Td> <Td> Yes </Td> </Tr> </Table>
<P> In unaffected persons homozygous for a standard functional allele ( AA ) , PAH activity is standard ( 100 % ) , and the concentration of phenylalanine in the blood ( Phe ) is about 60 uM . In untreated persons homozygous for one of the PKU alleles ( BB ) , PAH activity is close to zero , ( Phe ) ten to forty times standard , and the individual manifests PKU . </P>
<P> In the AB heterozygote , PAH activity is only 30 % ( not 50 % ) of standard , blood ( Phe ) is elevated two-fold , and the person does not manifest PKU . Thus , the A allele is dominant to the B allele with respect to PKU , but the B allele is incompletely dominant to the A allele with respect to its molecular effect , determination of PAH activity level ( 0.3 % < 30 % < < 100 % ) . Finally , the A allele is an incomplete dominant to B with respect to ( Phe ) , as 60 uM < 120 uM < < 600 uM . Note once more that it is irrelevant to the question of dominance that the recessive allele produces a more extreme ( Phe ) phenotype . </P>
<P> For a third allele C , a CC homozygote produces a very small amount of PAH enzyme , which results in a somewhat elevated level of ( Phe ) in the blood , a condition called hyperphenylalaninemia , which does not result in intellectual disability . </P>
<P> That is , the dominance relationships of any two alleles may vary according to which aspect of the phenotype is under consideration . It is typically more useful to talk about the phenotypic consequences of the allelic interactions involved in any genotype , rather than to try to force them into dominant and recessive categories . </P>
<P> Dominance is also unrelated to the distribution of alleles in the population . Some dominant alleles are extremely common , while others are extremely rare . The most common allele in a population may be recessive when combined with some rare variants . </P>

<P> Las Vegas was one of the largest cities in the United States without a major league sports team prior to the entry of the Golden Knights into the NHL . Due in part to perceived risks with legal sports betting , no major professional sports league had ever had a team in Las Vegas until the NHL decision to expand there came in June 2016 , though the NBA 's Utah Jazz played 11 home games at the Thomas & Mack Center in the 1983 -- 84 season . The placement of a major league team in Las Vegas was an ongoing topic of discussion between city leaders and the professional sports leagues . </P>
<P> Historically , the most prominent issue was the perceived problem of legal sports betting . Traditionally , all four major professional sports leagues had strong anti-gambling policies , prohibiting their personnel from having any involvement in gambling . The NFL took the toughest stance , even refusing to accept Las Vegas tourism advertising for Super Bowl telecasts and threatening to file suit against any local hotels holding Super Bowl parties . Hotels got around the legal threat by referring to the Super Bowl as `` The Big Game '' rather than its actual name in advertising . In addition , some potential owners believed a professional sports franchise would have difficulty gaining an audience , given Las Vegas 's numerous entertainment options . A number of prior professional football teams in the city ranked at or near last in their leagues in attendance over the years , such as the Las Vegas Posse , Las Vegas Locomotives and arena football Las Vegas Outlaws . Las Vegas also has a high percentage of residents working in 24 - hour occupations , many of whom work nights and weekends when most games would be played . Several owners of other sports franchises disagreed . Miami Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria described Las Vegas as `` a potential gold mine '' for a professional sports team owner . Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was also quoted as saying that Las Vegas would be a good professional sports town . </P>
<P> As the four leagues embraced daily fantasy sports ( DFS ) and mobile sports betting became more prevalent the perceptions that the four major professional sports leagues had of Las Vegas changed and the doors opened to major pro sports in the market . NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he was in favor of regulated , legalized sports gambling and later the NHL became the first of the four professional sports leagues to land in Vegas , with the expansion team Vegas Golden Knights debuting in October 2017 . The NFL , once a staunch opponent of Las Vegas , became the second of the four leagues to come to Vegas with the relocation of the Oakland Raiders to the area by 2020 . </P>
<P> Prior to the opening of T - Mobile Arena in April 2016 , another major obstacle was the lack of suitable facilities . The city did not have a facility that was large enough or modern enough to host an MLB or NFL team . While the Thomas & Mack Center and MGM Grand Garden Arena were large enough on paper to host an NBA or NHL team , they were not suitable for anything beyond temporary use due to age and / or design issues . </P>
<P> Harrah 's Entertainment and the Anschutz Entertainment Group committed to building a new arena on a parcel of land behind Harrah 's Paris and Bally 's off the Strip , to be built to NHL and NBA standards . The arena was expected to open in the fall of 2010 , but construction never began . Harrah 's Entertainment CEO Gary Loveman said in a June , 2009 article in Las Vegas Business Press that his company was still committed to building the arena , but it was delayed by a lack of financing . On April 6 , 2010 the Las Vegas Review - Journal reported that three proposals had been made to build an arena of approximately 20,000 seats on or near the Strip to host professional basketball and hockey , rodeo , concerts and other events . All three proposals called for public money to be used for a portion of the construction cost . On November 5 , 2013 , Las Vegas news media reported plans for a joint - venture arena to be built on the Strip with the backing parties being AEG and MGM Resorts . Located at a former parking lot at the back of the Monte Carlo , T - Mobile Arena seats 20,000 and costs $350 million . Ground was broken on May 2014 , with its opening on April 6 , 2016 . </P>
<P> Cashman Field is planned to be replaced for baseball by Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin by 2019 . Sam Boyd Stadium is scheduled to be replaced with Las Vegas Stadium which will be the home of the Las Vegas Raiders and UNLV Football beginning in 2020 . Ground was broken for Las Vegas Stadium on November 13 , 2017 . </P>
<P> Las Vegas is the home to the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . The Golden Knights are owned by Black Knight Sports & Entertainment , a consortium led by Bill Foley , and play at T - Mobile Arena . The Golden Knights began play during the 2017 -- 18 NHL season and became the first major league professional team in Las Vegas . </P>
<P> Prior to the Golden Knights , the National Hockey League had experience with Las Vegas beginning in 1991 , when an outdoor game was held in Las Vegas , with the Los Angeles Kings facing the New York Rangers outside Caesars Palace in a preseason exhibition game . It carried thorough the years with an annual preseason exhibition game called Frozen Fury which was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . The league has also held the NHL Awards ceremonies after each season since 2009 . </P>
<P> Las Vegas will be home to the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League ( NFL ) possibly beginning as soon as after the 2018 NFL season . On March 27 , 2017 , NFL owners voted 31 -- 1 to approve the Oakland Raiders ' move to Las Vegas , who will continue to play at the Oakland -- Alameda County Coliseum in Oakland in 2017 and possibly longer , until their new stadium , the Las Vegas Stadium , is built in time for the 2020 NFL season . </P>
<P> Prior to the Raiders approved relocation to Las Vegas , professional outdoor football had been attempted three times in the area . The first two attempts , the XFL 's Las Vegas Outlaws and the Canadian Football League 's Las Vegas Posse , were unsuccessful , with both teams folding after only one season of play . The XFL folded outright , while the Posse were a failure at the box office , part of the CFL 's failed U.S. expansion attempt . A third attempt at professional football was begun in the fall of 2009 with the United Football League 's Las Vegas Locomotives ; however , the franchise and the league folded in 2012 . The Locomotives played in the league 's first three championship games , winning the first two in 2009 and 2010 . </P>
<P> In October 2017 , multiple national media outlets reported that Spurs Sports & Entertainment , owner of the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) and its Women 's National Basketball Association ( WNBA ) sister team , the San Antonio Stars , had reached an agreement to sell the Stars to a Las Vegas - based group that would move the team to the area effective with the 2018 season . The NBA and WNBA officially approved the sale on October 17 , 2017 and announced the Las Vegas Aces will be playing at the Mandalay Bay Events Center starting in the 2018 season . </P>
<P> In April 2004 , Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Commissioner Bud Selig publicly revealed that baseball was considering Las Vegas as a potential home for the Montreal Expos . The lack of a baseball park that could be quickly reconfigured for Major League Baseball cost the city any chance of landing the team . Baseball eventually chose Washington , D.C. , primarily because the city agreed to provide a new stadium built entirely with public funding . </P>
<P> A news item on a local television station dated August 26 , 2010 reported that then Mayor Oscar Goodman was still actively pursuing a Major League Baseball franchise for the city . He was reportedly rebuffed by the owner of an unnamed team due to the small size of the market and the weak local economy . </P>
<P> Rumors surfaced in 2005 about the possible relocation of the National Basketball Association 's ( NBA ) Sacramento Kings to Las Vegas . In November 2006 , California voters rejected a proposal to fund a new arena in Sacramento , considered to be a condition of the team remaining there . Another possible factor was that the owners of the Kings , the Maloof family , also owned the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas . Changes in the Kings owners ' financial situation led to a decision to sell the club to a group planning to keep the team in Sacramento , which finalized the purchase of the Kings in May 2013 . </P>
<P> The Milwaukee Bucks had also been mentioned as possible candidates for relocation to Las Vegas , as were the Seattle SuperSonics before their relocation to Oklahoma City . </P>
<P> Former UNLV and NBA player Jackie Robinson was working to build the All Net Resort and Arena , a $1.4 billion privately funded complex encompassing an arena , hotel and shopping project near the SLS Las Vegas and Turnberry Towers that could attract an NBA franchise to Las Vegas . The arena itself would cost $670 million , being operated by Comcast - Spectacor ( owners of another NBA stadium , Philadelphia 's Wells Fargo Center ) . Designed by the Cuningham Group , the arena was planned to open in 2017 . The All Net Arena saw its groundbreaking ceremony on October 29 , 2014 , and Robinson entered into negotiations with Clark County expecting to begin construction by Fall 2015 . However , the plan was placed on hold in 2016 , presumably due to the progress made on T - Mobile Arena . </P>
<P> Las Vegas hosted the 2007 NBA All - Star Game , the only time the event has been held in a non-NBA city . As part of the conditions the NBA set for holding the game in Las Vegas , sports books agreed not to take bets on the game . The NBA Summer League is currently held in Paradise , Nevada . The 2008 and 2012 United States men 's Olympic basketball teams trained in Las Vegas , and played a game at the Thomas & Mack Center against the Dominican Republic . </P>
<P> In October 2016 , during an interview with KNPR 's State of Nevada , MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren said he 's working on bringing an NBA team to Las Vegas , to play at the T - Mobile Arena . `` It would n't be an expansion team , '' Murren said . `` It would most likely be the relocation of an existing team . '' </P>
<P> The local media reported in the summer of 2008 that Las Vegas was on the short list of cities Major League Soccer ( MLS ) was considering for an expansion franchise in the near future . After a controversial campaign by Mayor Carolyn Goodman and Cordish Company to use public dollars for a new taxpayer - funded stadium , the proposal faced public backlash before MLS ultimately decided to pass on Las Vegas in February 2015 . </P>
<P> Las Vegas is home to the Las Vegas 51s of the Pacific Coast League ( AAA ) who play at Cashman Field . The 51 's are currently the AAA affiliate of the New York Mets and the only professional team that plays in the City of Las Vegas . On October 11 , 2017 , the Las Vegas 51s got approval to build Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin , Nevada . However , the Mets also announced the end of their affiliation with the Las Vegas 51s effective after the 2018 season . </P>
<P> Beginning in 2018 , Las Vegas became home to a USL soccer team known as the Las Vegas Lights FC . The team shares Cashman Field with the baseball 51s and is the second team to play within the Las Vegas city limits . </P>
<P> Since Cashman Field ( the only sports facility the city owns ) opened in 1983 , all but three other cities in AAA baseball ( Pawtucket , Tacoma and Portland ) have opened new ballparks . Little has been done to improve Cashman since it opened . </P>
<P> After the toilets backed up during a 2015 game , PCL president Branch Barrett Rickey wrote a letter to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to warn that the upgrades needed to keep Cashman at something approaching Triple - A standards would require spending `` tens of millions of dollars . '' Rickey added that even that would n't be enough , as many experts inside and outside Las Vegas believed that Cashman was at the end of its useful life . </P>
<P> Because it lags so far behind most other facilities in AAA baseball there was danger that Las Vegas would lose its place in minor league baseball 's top tier ( which happened to Portland after the 2010 season , after plans for a new park fell through ) . Dissatisfaction with the facilities , along with the lack of a plan to improve the situation , was cited as a major reason the Los Angeles Dodgers did not renew their working agreement with the Las Vegas 51s after it expired in 2008 . The Dodgers resumed what had been a long - term affiliation with Albuquerque , where a new ballpark opened in 2003 . The 51s plain to construct and open Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin by 2019 . </P>
<P> In 1999 , UNLV officials refused to discuss a new agreement with the owners of the Las Vegas Thunder of the International Hockey League to play at the Thomas & Mack Center . Hotels with facilities suitable for the Thunder would not commit to an entire hockey season , as this would have seriously restricted the dates available for concerts and other events . This left the Thunder without a place to play . The team was disbanded , and the city lost hockey for four years . Only the opening of a new arena ( considerably smaller than the Thomas & Mack ) at the off - Strip Orleans Hotel allowed for the return of hockey with the Las Vegas Wranglers of the ECHL . The ECHL is considered two steps below the NHL , or the equivalent of the ' AA ' level in minor league baseball . The Thunder was one step above that . The Wranglers ceased operations after the 2013 - ' 14 season after Orleans Hotel owners Boyd Gaming informed the team that their lease at the Orleans Arena would not be renewed , and efforts to find a new location failed . </P>
<P> The Las Vegas Locomotives began play in October 2009 in the inaugural season of the United Football League . The Locos played in the first three UFL championship games , winning the first two against the Florida Tuskers , while losing the 2011 edition to the relocated Tuskers , then the Virginia Destroyers . The head coach was Jim Fassel , former head coach of the NFL 's New York Giants . The team played home games at UNLV 's Sam Boyd Stadium . The league suspended operations in the middle of the 2012 season , with Las Vegas undefeated through the first four games . Las Vegas , despite being the league 's best and most consistent team on the field , was also consistently one of the poorest draws at the gate in the league ; their final home game drew only 600 fans into the stadium , a league record low . </P>
<P> Af2 , a second - tier arena football league , announced on June 24 that the ArenaCup , the league championship game , would be played in Las Vegas at the Orleans Arena on August 22 , 2009 . Af2 President Jerry Kurz stated that the league had serious plans to put a team in Las Vegas to play at the Orleans Arena . He said that he had `` no qualms '' about this even given the problems that the Las Vegas Gladiators of the Arena Football League had in the city . This turned out to be the last season of af2 due to the demise of its parent league , the original Arena Football League . </P>
<P> In 2005 -- 06 , the city hosted ArenaBowl XIX and ArenaBowl XX at the Thomas & Mack Center , the AFL 's first neutral - site title games . After two years of disappointing attendance the game was moved . </P>

<P> The city has become a regional hub for college basketball conference tournaments . The Mountain West Conference ( MW ) holds its annual tournaments for both men and women at the Thomas & Mack Center . Las Vegas hosted the tournaments for the first seven years of the MW 's existence , with the tournaments returning to Las Vegas in 2009 after three years in Denver . In 2009 the West Coast Conference , which does not have a team in Nevada , moved its men 's and women 's tournaments to the Orleans Arena . The Western Athletic Conference moved both of its tournaments to Las Vegas in 2011 . The WAC also plays at the Orleans Arena . </P>
<P> On March 14 , 2012 the Las Vegas Review - Journal reported that the Pac - 12 Conference was moving its men 's basketball conference tournament to Las Vegas in 2013 , to be played at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . The tournament remained at this venue through the 2016 edition , after which it moved to T - Mobile Arena . </P>
<P> Las Vegas hosts the Las Vegas Bowl , a college bowl game , around Christmas Day . The game generally pairs a Pac - 12 team and an MW team . </P>
<P> Despite the state of Nevada having no collegiate wrestling itself , many of the most prestigious college wrestling events are held in the area each year . The Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational tournament has been held in the city since 1981 . Some of the nations best wrestling teams , such as Michigan , Nebraska , Virginia Tech , Minnesota , Iowa State , Ohio State and Northern Iowa often attend the event .

<P> Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire . It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture . </P>
<P> The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror . Since the time of Henry I , it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest - occupied palace in Europe . The castle 's lavish early 19th - century State Apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as `` a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste '' . Inside the castle walls is the 15th - century St George 's Chapel , considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be `` one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic '' design . </P>
<P> Originally designed to protect Norman dominance around the outskirts of London and oversee a strategically important part of the River Thames , Windsor Castle was built as a motte - and - bailey , with three wards surrounding a central mound . Gradually replaced with stone fortifications , the castle withstood a prolonged siege during the First Barons ' War at the start of the 13th century . Henry III built a luxurious royal palace within the castle during the middle of the century , and Edward III went further , rebuilding the palace to make an even grander set of buildings in what would become `` the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England '' . Edward 's core design lasted through the Tudor period , during which Henry VIII and Elizabeth I made increasing use of the castle as a royal court and centre for diplomatic entertainment . </P>
<P> Windsor Castle survived the tumultuous period of the English Civil War , when it was used as a military headquarters by Parliamentary forces and a prison for Charles I . At the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , Charles II rebuilt much of Windsor Castle with the help of the architect Hugh May , creating a set of extravagant Baroque interiors that are still admired . After a period of neglect during the 18th century , George III and George IV renovated and rebuilt Charles II 's palace at colossal expense , producing the current design of the State Apartments , full of Rococo , Gothic and Baroque furnishings . Queen Victoria made a few minor changes to the castle , which became the centre for royal entertainment for much of her reign . Windsor Castle was used as a refuge by the royal family during the Luftwaffe bombing campaigns of the Second World War and survived a fire in 1992 . It is a popular tourist attraction , a venue for hosting state visits , and the preferred weekend home of Elizabeth II . </P>
<P> Windsor Castle occupies 13 acres ( 5.3 ha ) , and combines the features of a fortification , a palace , and a small town . The present - day castle was created during a sequence of phased building projects , culminating in the reconstruction work after a fire in 1992 . It is in essence a Georgian and Victorian design based on a medieval structure , with Gothic features reinvented in a modern style . Since the 14th century , architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions , repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles . As a result , architect Sir William Whitfield has pointed to Windsor Castle 's architecture as having `` a certain fictive quality '' , the Picturesque and Gothic design generating `` a sense that a theatrical performance is being put on here '' , despite late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity . Although there has been some criticism , the castle 's architecture and history lends it a `` place amongst the greatest European palaces '' . </P>
<P> At the heart of Windsor Castle is the Middle Ward , a bailey formed around the motte or artificial hill in the centre of the ward . The motte is 50 feet ( 15 m ) high and is made from chalk originally excavated from the surrounding ditch . The keep , called the Round Tower , on the top of the motte is based on an original 12th - century building , extended upwards in the early 19th century under architect Jeffry Wyatville by 30 ft ( 9 m ) to produce a more imposing height and silhouette . The interior of the Round Tower was further redesigned in 1991 -- 3 to provide additional space for the Royal Archives , an additional room being built in the space left by Wyatville 's originally hollow extension . The Round Tower is in reality far from cylindrical , due to the shape and structure of the motte beneath it . The current height of the tower has been criticised as being disproportionate to its width ; archaeologist Tim Tatton - Brown , for example , has described it as a mutilation of the earlier medieval structure . </P>
<P> The western entrance to the Middle Ward is now open , and a gateway leads north from the ward onto the North Terrace . The eastern exit from the ward is guarded by the Norman Gatehouse . This gatehouse , which , despite its name , dates from the 14th century , is heavily vaulted and decorated with carvings , including surviving medieval lion masks , traditional symbols of majesty , to form an impressive entrance to the Upper Ward . Wyatville redesigned the exterior of the gatehouse , and the interior was later heavily converted in the 19th century for residential use . </P>
<P> The Upper Ward of Windsor Castle comprises a number of major buildings enclosed by the upper bailey wall , forming a central quadrangle . The State Apartments run along the north of the ward , with a range of buildings along the east wall , and the private royal apartments and the King George IV Gate to the south , with the Edward III Tower in the south - west corner . The motte and the Round Tower form the west edge of the ward . A bronze statue of Charles II on horseback sits beneath the Round Tower . Inspired by Hubert Le Sueur 's statue of Charles I in London , the statue was cast by Josias Ibach in 1679 , with the marble plinth featuring carvings by Grinling Gibbons . The Upper Ward adjoins the North Terrace , which overlooks the River Thames , and the East Terrace , which overlooks the gardens ; both of the current terraces were constructed by Hugh May in the 17th century . </P>
<P> Traditionally the Upper Ward was judged to be `` to all intents and purposes a nineteenth - century creation ... the image of what the early nineteenth - century thought a castle should be '' , as a result of the extensive redesign of the castle by Wyatville under George IV . The walls of the Upper Ward are built of Bagshot Heath stone faced on the inside with regular bricks , the gothic details in yellow Bath stone . The buildings in the Upper Ward are characterised by the use of small bits of flint in the mortar for galletting , originally started at the castle in the 17th century to give stonework from disparate periods a similar appearance . The skyline of the Upper Ward is designed to be dramatic when seen from a distance or silhouetted against the horizon , an image of tall towers and battlements influenced by the picturesque movement of the late 18th century . Archaeological and restoration work following the 1992 fire has shown the extent to which the current structure represents a survival of elements from the original 12th - century stone walls onwards , presented within the context of Wyatville 's final remodelling . </P>
<P> The State Apartments form the major part of the Upper Ward and lie along the north side of the quadrangle . The modern building follows the medieval foundations laid down by Edward III , with the ground floor comprising service chambers and cellars , and the much grander first floor forming the main part of the palace . On the first floor , the layout of the western end of the State Apartments is primarily the work of architect Hugh May , whereas the structure on the eastern side represents Jeffry Wyatville 's plans . </P>
<P> The interior of the State Apartments was mostly designed by Wyatville in the early 19th century . Wyatville intended each room to illustrate a particular architectural style and to display the matching furnishings and fine arts of the period . With some alterations over the years , this concept continues to dominate the apartments . Different rooms follow the Classical , Gothic and Rococo styles , together with an element of Jacobethan in places . Many of the rooms on the eastern end of the castle had to be restored following the 1992 fire , using `` equivalent restoration '' methods -- the rooms were restored so as to appear similar to their original appearance , but using modern materials and concealing modern structural improvements . These rooms were also partially redesigned at the same time to more closely match modern tastes . Art historian Hugh Roberts has praised the State Apartments as `` a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste . '' Others , such as architect Robin Nicolson and critic Hugh Pearman , have described them as `` bland '' and `` distinctly dull '' . </P>
<P> Wyatville 's most famous work are those rooms designed in a Rococo style . These rooms take the fluid , playful aspects of this mid-18th - century artistic movement , including many original pieces of Louis XV decoration , but project them on a `` vastly inflated '' scale . Investigations after the 1992 fire have shown though that many Rococo features of the modern castle , originally thought to have been 18th - century fittings transferred from Carlton House or France , are in fact 19th - century imitations in plasterwork and wood , designed to blend with original elements . The Grand Reception Room is the most prominent of these Rococo designs , 100 ft ( 30 m ) long and 40 ft ( 12 m ) tall and occupying the site of Edward III 's great hall . This room , restored after the fire , includes a huge French Rococo ceiling , characterised by Ian Constantinides , the lead restorer , as possessing a `` coarseness of form and crudeness of hand ... completely overshadowed by the sheer spectacular effect when you are at a distance '' . The room is set off by a set of restored Gobelins French tapestries . Although decorated with less gold leaf than in the 1820s , the result remains `` one of the greatest set - pieces of Regency decoration '' . The White , Green and Crimson Drawing Rooms include a total of 62 trophies : carved , gilded wooden panels illustrating weapons and the spoils of war , many with Masonic meanings . Restored or replaced after the fire , these trophies are famous for their `` vitality , precision and three - dimensional quality '' , and were originally brought from Carlton House in 1826 , some being originally imported from France and others carved by Edward Wyatt . The soft furnishings of these rooms , although luxurious , are more modest than the 1820s originals , both on the grounds of modern taste and cost . </P>
<P> Wyatville 's design retains three rooms originally built by May in the 17th century in partnership with the painter Antonio Verrio and carver Grinling Gibbons . The Queen 's Presence Chamber , the Queen 's Audience Chamber and the King 's Dining Room are designed in a Baroque , Franco - Italian style , characterised by `` gilded interiors enriched with florid murals '' , first introduced to England between 1648 -- 50 at Wilton House . Verrio 's paintings are `` drenched in medievalist allusion '' and classical images . These rooms were intended to show an innovative English `` baroque fusion '' of the hitherto separate arts of architecture , painting and carving . </P>
<P> A handful of rooms in the modern State Apartments reflect either 18th - century or Victorian Gothic design . The State Dining Room , for example , whose current design originates from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 fire , is restored to its appearance in the 1920s , before the removal of some of the gilded features on the pilasters . Anthony Salvin 's Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian design in the Gothic style , rising to a double - height hall lit by an older 18th - century Gothic vaulted lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule , designed by James Wyatt and executed by Francis Bernasconi . The staircase has been criticised by historian John Robinson as being a distinctly inferior design to the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May . </P>
<P> Some parts of the State Apartments were completely destroyed in the 1992 fire and this area was rebuilt in a style called `` Downesian Gothic '' , named after the architect , Giles Downes . The style comprises `` the rather stripped , cool and systematic coherence of modernism sewn into a reinterpretation of the Gothic tradition '' . Downes argues that the style avoids `` florid decoration '' , emphasising an organic , flowing Gothic structure . Three new rooms were built or remodelled by Downes at Windsor . Downes ' new roof of St George 's Hall is the largest green - oak structure built since the Middle Ages , and is decorated with brightly coloured shields celebrating the heraldic element of the Order of the Garter ; the design attempts to create an illusion of additional height through the gothic woodwork along the ceiling . The Lantern Lobby features flowing oak columns forming a vaulted ceiling , imitating an arum lily . The new Private Chapel is relatively small , only able to fit thirty worshippers , but combines architectural elements of the St George 's Hall roof with the Lantern Lobby and the stepped arch structure of the Henry VIII chapel vaulting at Hampton Court . The result is an `` extraordinary , continuous and closely moulded net of tracery '' , complementing the new stained glass windows commemorating the fire , designed by Joseph Nuttgen . The Great Kitchen , with its newly exposed 14th - century roof lantern sitting alongside Wyatville 's fireplaces , chimneys and Gothic tables , is also a product of the reconstruction after the fire . </P>
<P> The ground floor of the State Apartments retains various famous medieval features . The 14th - century Great Undercroft still survives , some 193 feet ( 59 m ) long by 31 feet ( 9.4 m ) wide , divided into 13 bays . At the time of the 1992 fire , the Undercroft had been divided into smaller rooms ; the area is now opened up to form a single space in an effort to echo the undercrofts at Fountains and Rievaulx Abbeys , although the floor remains artificially raised for convenience of use . The `` beautifully vaulted '' 14th - century Larderie passage runs alongside the Kitchen Courtyard and is decorated with carved royal roses , marking its construction by Edward III . </P>
<P> The Lower Ward lies below and to the west of the Round Tower , reached through the Norman Gate . Originally largely of medieval design , most of the Lower Ward was renovated or reconstructed during the mid-Victorian period by Anthony Salvin and Edward Blore , to form a `` consistently Gothic composition '' . The Lower Ward holds St George 's Chapel and most of the buildings associated with the Order of the Garter . </P>
<P> On the north side of the Lower Ward is St George 's Chapel . This huge building is the spiritual home of the Order of the Knights of the Garter and dates from the late 15th and early 16th century , designed in the Perpendicular Gothic style . The ornate wooden choir stalls are of 15th - century design , having been restored and extended by Henry Emlyn at the end of the 18th century , and are decorated with a unique set of brass plates showing the arms of the Knights of the Garter over the last six centuries . On the west side , the chapel has a grand Victorian door and staircase , used on ceremonial occasions . The east stained glass window is Victorian , and the oriel window to the north side of it was built by Henry VIII for Catherine of Aragon . The vault in front of the altar houses the remains of Henry VIII , Jane Seymour and Charles I , with Edward IV buried nearby . The chapel is considered by historian John Robinson to be `` one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic '' design . </P>
<P> At the east end of St George 's Chapel is the Lady Chapel , originally built by Henry III in the 13th century and converted into the Albert Memorial Chapel between 1863 -- 73 by George Gilbert Scott . Built to commemorate the life of Prince Albert , the ornate chapel features lavish decoration and works in marble , glass mosaic and bronze by Henri de Triqueti , Susan Durant , Alfred Gilbert and Antonio Salviati . The east door of the chapel , covered in ornamental ironwork , is the original door from 1246 . </P>
<P> At the west end of the Lower Ward is the Horseshoe Cloister , originally built in 1480 , near to the chapel to house its clergy . It houses the vicars - choral , or lay clerks of the chapel . This curved brick and timber building is said to have been designed to resemble the shape of a fetlock , one of the badges used by Edward IV . George Gilbert Scott heavily restored the building in 1871 and little of the original structure remains . Other ranges originally built by Edward III sit alongside the Horseshoe , featuring stone perpendicular tracery . As of 2011 , they are used as offices , a library and as the houses for the Dean and Canons . </P>
<P> Behind the Horseshoe Cloister is the Curfew Tower , one of the oldest surviving parts of the Lower Ward and dating from the 13th century . The interior of the tower contains a former dungeon , and the remnants of a sally port , a secret exit for the occupants in a time of siege . The upper storey contains the castle bells placed there in 1478 , and the castle clock of 1689 . The French - style conical roof is a 19th - century attempt by Anthony Salvin to remodel the tower in the fashion of Eugène Viollet - le - Duc 's recreation of Carcassonne . </P>
<P> On the opposite side of the chapel is a range of buildings including the lodgings of the Military Knights , and the residence of the Governor of the Military Knights . These buildings originate from the 16th century and are still used by the Knights , who represent the Order of the Garter each Sunday . On the south side of the Ward is King Henry VIII 's gateway , which bears the coat of arms of Catherine of Aragon and forms the secondary entrance to the castle . </P>
<P> Windsor Castle 's position on top of steep ground has meant that the castle 's gardens are limited in scale . The castle gardens stretch east from the Upper Ward across a 19th - century terrace . Windsor Castle is surrounded by extensive parkland . The immediate area stretching to the east of the castle is a 19th - century creation known as the Home Park . The Home Park includes parkland and two working farms , along with many estate cottages mainly occupied by employees and the Frogmore estate . The Long Walk , a double lined avenue of trees , runs for 2.65 miles ( 4.26 km ) south of the castle , and is 240 ft ( 75 m ) wide . The original 17th - century elms were replaced with alternating chestnut and plane trees . The impact of Dutch elm disease led to large - scale replanting after 1945 . </P>
<P> The Home Park adjoins the northern edge of the more extensive Windsor Great Park , occupying some 5,000 acres ( 2,020 ha ) and including some of the oldest broadleaved woodlands in Europe . In the Home Park , to the north of the castle , stands a private school , St George 's , which provides choristers to the chapel . Eton College is located about half a mile from the castle , across the River Thames . </P>
<P> Windsor Castle was originally built by William the Conqueror in the decade after the Norman conquest of 1066 . William established a defensive ring of motte and bailey castles around London ; each was a day 's march -- about 20 miles ( 32 km ) -- from the city and from the next castle , allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis . Windsor Castle , one of this ring of fortifications , was strategically important because of its proximity to both the River Thames , a key medieval route into London , and Windsor Forest , a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings . The nearby settlement of Clivore , or Clewer , was an old Saxon residence . The initial wooden castle consisted of a keep on the top of a man - made motte , or mound , protected by a small bailey wall , occupying a chalk inlier , or bluff , rising 100 ft ( 30 m ) above the river . A second wooden bailey was constructed to the east of the keep , forming the later Upper Ward . By the end of the century , another bailey had been constructed to the west , creating the basic shape of the modern castle . In design , Windsor most closely resembled Arundel Castle , another powerful early Norman fortification , but the double bailey design was also found at Rockingham and Alnwick Castle . </P>
<P> Windsor was not initially used as a royal residence ; the early Norman kings preferred to use the former palace of Edward the Confessor in the village of Old Windsor . The first king to use Windsor Castle as a residence was Henry I , who celebrated Whitsuntide at the castle in 1110 during a period of heightened insecurity . Henry 's marriage to Adela , the daughter of Godfrey of Louvain , took place in the castle in 1121 . During this period the keep suffered a substantial collapse -- archaeological evidence shows that the southern side of the motte subsided by over 6 ft ( 2 m ) . Timber piles were driven in to support the motte and the old wooden keep was replaced with a new stone shell keep , with a probable gateway to the north - east and a new stone well . A chemise , or low protective wall , was subsequently added to the keep . </P>
<P> Henry II came to the throne in 1154 and built extensively at Windsor between 1165 and 1179 . Henry replaced the wooden palisade surrounding the upper ward with a stone wall interspersed with square towers and built the first King 's Gate . The first stone keep was suffering from subsidence , and cracks were beginning to appear in the stonework of the south side . Henry replaced the keep with another stone shell keep and chemise wall , but moved the walls in from the edge of the motte to relieve the pressure on the mound , and added massive foundations along the south side to provide additional support . Inside the castle Henry remodelled the royal accommodation . Bagshot Heath stone was used for most of the work , and stone from Bedfordshire for the internal buildings . </P>
<P> King John undertook some building works at Windsor , but primarily to the accommodation rather than the defences . The castle played a role during the revolt of the English barons : the castle was besieged in 1214 , and John used the castle as his base during the negotiations before the signing of the Magna Carta at nearby Runnymede in 1215 . In 1216 the castle was besieged again by baronial and French troops under the command of the Count of Nevers , but John 's constable , Engelard de Cigogné , successfully defended it . </P>
<P> The damage done to the castle during the second siege was immediately repaired in 1216 and 1221 by Cigogne on behalf of John 's successor Henry III , who further strengthened the defences . The walls of the Lower Ward were rebuilt in stone , complete with a gatehouse in the location of the future Henry VIII Gate , between 1224 and 1230 . Three new towers , the Curfew , Garter and the Salisbury towers , were constructed . The Middle Ward was heavily reinforced with a southern stone wall , protected by the new Edward III and Henry III towers at each end . </P>
<P> Windsor Castle was one of Henry 's three favourite residences and he invested heavily in the royal accommodation , spending more money at Windsor than in any other of his properties . Following his marriage to Eleanor of Provence , Henry built a luxurious palace in 1240 -- 63 , based around a court along the north side of the Upper Ward . This was intended primarily for the queen and Henry 's children . In the Lower Ward , the king ordered the construction of a range of buildings for his own use along the south wall , including a 70 ft ( 21 m ) long chapel , later called the Lady Chapel . This was the grandest of the numerous chapels built for his own use , and comparable to the Sainte - Chapelle in Paris in size and quality . Henry repaired the Great Hall that lay along the north side of the Lower Ward , and enlarged it with a new kitchen and built a covered walkway between the Hall and the kitchen . Henry 's work was characterised by the religious overtones of the rich decorations , which formed `` one of the high - water marks of English medieval art '' . The conversion cost more than £ 10,000 . The result was to create a division in the castle between a more private Upper Ward and a Lower Ward devoted to the public face of the monarchy . Little further building was carried out at the castle during the 13th century ; the Great Hall in the Lower Ward was destroyed by fire in 1296 , but it was not rebuilt . </P>
<P> Edward III was born at Windsor Castle and used it extensively throughout his reign . In 1344 the king announced the foundation of the new Order of the Round Table at the castle . Edward began to construct a new building in the castle to host this order , but it was never finished . Chroniclers described it as a round building , 200 ft ( 61 m ) across , and it was probably in the centre of the Upper Ward . Shortly afterwards , Edward abandoned the new order for reasons that remain unclear , and instead established the Order of the Garter , again with Windsor Castle as its headquarters , complete with the attendant Poor Knights of Windsor . As part of this process Edward decided to rebuild Windsor Castle , in particular Henry III 's palace , in an attempt to construct a castle that would be symbolic of royal power and chivalry . Edward was influenced both by the military successes of his grandfather , Edward I , and by the decline of royal authority under his father , Edward II , and aimed to produce an innovative , `` self - consciously aesthetic , muscled , martial architecture '' . </P>
<P> Edward placed William of Wykeham in overall charge of the rebuilding and design of the new castle and whilst work was ongoing Edward stayed in temporary accommodation in the Round Tower . Between 1350 and 1377 Edward spent £ 51,000 on renovating Windsor Castle ; this was the largest amount spent by any English medieval monarch on a single building operation , and over one and a half times Edward 's typical annual income of £ 30,000 . Some of the costs of the castle were paid from the results of ransoms following Edward 's victories at the battles of Crécy , Calais and Poitiers . Windsor Castle was already a substantial building before Edward began expanding it , making the investment all the more impressive , and much of the expenditure was lavished on rich furnishings . The castle was `` the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England '' . </P>
<P> Edward 's new palace consisted of three courts along the north side of the Upper Ward , called Little Cloister , King 's Cloister and the Kitchen Court . At the front of the palace lay the St George 's Hall range , which combined a new hall and a new chapel . This range had two symmetrical gatehouses , the Spicerie Gatehouse and the Kitchen Gatehouse . The Spicerie Gatehouse was the main entrance into the palace , whilst the Kitchen Gatehouse simply led into the kitchen courtyard . The great hall had numerous large windows looking out across the ward . The range had an unusual , unified roof - line and , with a taller roof than the rest of the palace , would have been highly distinctive . The Rose Tower , designed for the king 's private use , set off the west corner of the range . The result was a `` great and apparently architecturally unified palace ... uniform in all sorts of ways , as to roof line , window heights , cornice line , floor and ceiling heights '' . With the exception of the Hall , Chapel and the Great Chamber , the new interiors all shared a similar height and width . The defensive features , however , were primarily for show , possibly to provide a backdrop for jousting between the two - halves of the Order of the Garter . </P>
<P> Edward built further luxurious , self - contained lodgings for his court around the east and south edges of the Upper Ward , creating the modern shape of the quadrangle . The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward . In the Lower Ward , the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside . The earliest weight - driven mechanical clock in England was installed by Edward III in the Round Tower in 1354 . William of Wykeham went on to build New College , Oxford and Winchester College , where the influence of Windsor Castle can easily be seen . </P>
<P> The new castle was used to hold French prisoners taken in at Poitiers in 1357 , including John II , who was held for a considerable ransom . Later in the century , the castle also found favour with Richard II . Richard conducted restoration work on St George 's Chapel , the work being carried out by Geoffrey Chaucer , who served as a diplomat and Clerk of The King 's Works . </P>
<P> Windsor Castle continued to be favoured by monarchs in the 15th century , despite England beginning to slip into increasing political violence . Henry IV seized the castle during his coup in 1399 , although failing to catch Richard II , who had escaped to London . Under Henry V , the castle hosted a visit from the Holy Roman Emperor in 1417 , a massive diplomatic event that stretched the accommodation of the castle to its limits . </P>
<P> By the middle of the 15th century England was increasingly divided between the rival royal factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists . Castles such as Windsor did not play a decisive role during the resulting Wars of the Roses ( 1455 -- 85 ) , which were fought primarily in the form of pitched battles between the rival factions . Henry VI , born at Windsor Castle and known as Henry of Windsor , became king at the young age of nine months . His long period of minority , coupled with the increasing tensions between Henry 's Lancastrian supporters and the Yorkists , distracted attention from Windsor . The Garter Feasts and other ceremonial activities at the castle became more infrequent and less well attended . </P>
<P> Edward IV seized power in 1461 . When Edward captured Henry 's wife , Margaret of Anjou , she was brought back to be detained at the castle . Edward began to revive the Order of the Garter , and held a particularly lavish feast in 1472 . Edward began the construction of the present St. George 's Chapel in 1475 , resulting in the dismantling of several of the older buildings in the Lower Ward . By building the grand chapel Edward was seeking to show that his new dynasty were the permanent rulers of England , and may also have been attempting to deliberately rival the similar chapel that Henry VI had ordered to be constructed at nearby Eton College . Richard III made only a brief use of Windsor Castle before his defeat at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 , but had the body of Henry VI moved from Chertsey Abbey in Surrey to the castle to allow it to be visited by pilgrims more easily . </P>
<P> Henry VII made more use of Windsor . In 1488 , shortly after succeeding to the throne , he held a massive feast for the Order of the Garter at the castle . He completed the roof of St George 's Chapel , and set about converting the older eastern Lady Chapel into a proposed shrine to Henry VI , whose canonisation was then considered imminent . In the event , Henry VI was not canonised and the project was abandoned , although the shrine continued to attract a flood of pilgrims . Henry VII appears to have remodelled the King 's Chamber in the palace , and had the roof of the Great Kitchen rebuilt in 1489 . He also built a three - storied tower on the west end of the palace , which he used for his personal apartments . Windsor began to be used for international diplomatic events , including the grand visit of Philip I of Castile in 1506 . William de la Pole , one of the surviving Yorkist claimants to the throne , was imprisoned at Windsor Castle during Henry 's reign , before his execution in 1513 . </P>
<P> Henry VIII enjoyed Windsor Castle , as a young man `` exercising himself daily in shooting , singing , dancing , wrestling , casting of the bar , playing at the recorders , flute , virginals , in setting of songs and making of ballads '' . The tradition of the Garter Feasts was maintained and became more extravagant ; the size of the royal retinue visiting Windsor had to be restricted because of the growing numbers . During the Pilgrimage of Grace , a huge uprising in the north of England against Henry 's rule in 1536 , the king used Windsor as a secure base in the south from which to manage his military response . Throughout the Tudor period , Windsor was also used as a safe retreat in the event of plagues occurring in London . </P>
<P> Henry rebuilt the principal castle gateway in about 1510 and constructed a tennis court at the base of the motte in the Upper Ward . He also built a long terrace , called the North Wharf , along the outside wall of the Upper Ward ; constructed of wood , it was designed to provide a commanding view of the River Thames below . The design included an outside staircase into the king 's apartments , which made the monarch 's life more comfortable at the expense of considerably weakening the castle 's defences . Early in his reign , Henry had given the eastern Lady Chapel to Cardinal Wolsey for Wolsey 's future mausoleum . Benedetto Grazzini converted much of this into an Italian Renaissance design , before Wolsey 's fall from power brought an end to the project , with contemporaries estimating that around £ 60,000 ( £ 295 million in 2008 terms ) had been spent on the work . Henry continued the project , but it remained unfinished when he himself was buried in the chapel , in an elaborate funeral in 1547 . </P>
<P> By contrast , the young Edward VI disliked Windsor Castle . Edward 's Protestant beliefs led him to simplify the Garter ceremonies , to discontinue the annual Feast of the Garter at Windsor and to remove any signs of Catholic practices with the Order . During the rebellions and political strife of 1549 , Windsor was again used as a safe - haven for the king and the Duke of Somerset . Edward famously commented whilst staying at Windsor Castle during this period that `` Methink I am in a prison , here are no galleries , nor no gardens to walk in '' . Under both Edward and his sister , Mary I , some limited building work continued at the castle , in many cases using resources recovered from the English abbeys . Water was piped into the Upper Ward to create a fountain . Mary also expanded the buildings used by the Knights of Windsor in the Lower Ward , using stone from Reading Abbey . </P>
<P> Elizabeth I spent much of her time at Windsor Castle and used it a safe haven in crises , `` knowing it could stand a siege if need be '' . Ten new brass cannons were purchased for the castle 's defence . It became one of her favourite locations and she spent more money on the property than on any of her other palaces . She conducted some modest building works at Windsor , including a wide range of repairs to the existing structures . She converted the North Wharf into a permanent , huge stone terrace , complete with statues , carvings and an octagonal , outdoor banqueting house , raising the western end of the terrace to provide more privacy . The chapel was refitted with stalls , a gallery and a new ceiling . A bridge was built over the ditch to the south of the castle to enable easier access to the park . Elizabeth built a gallery range of buildings on the west end of the Upper Ward , alongside Henry VII 's tower . Elizabeth increasingly used the castle for diplomatic engagements , but space continued to prove a challenge as the property was simply not as large as the more modern royal palaces . This flow of foreign visitors was captured for the queen 's entertainment in William Shakespeare 's play , The Merry Wives of Windsor . </P>
<P> James I used Windsor Castle primarily as a base for hunting , one of his favourite pursuits , and for socialising with his friends . Many of these occasions involved extensive drinking sessions , including one with Christian IV of Denmark in 1606 that became infamous across Europe for the resulting drunken behaviour of the two kings . The absence of space at Windsor continued to prove problematic , with James ' English and Scottish retinues often quarrelling over rooms . </P>
<P> Charles I was a connoisseur of art , and paid greater attention to the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors . Charles had the castle completely surveyed by a team including Inigo Jones in 1629 , but little of the recommended work was carried out . Nonetheless , Charles employed Nicholas Stone to improve the chapel gallery in the Mannerist style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace . Christian van Vianen , a noted Dutch goldsmith , was employed to produce a baroque gold service for the St George 's Chapel altar . In the final years of peace , Charles demolished the fountain in the Upper Ward , intending to replace it with a classical statue . </P>
<P> In 1642 the English Civil War broke out , dividing the country into the Royalist supporters of Charles , and the Parliamentarians . In the aftermath of the battle of Edgehill in October , Parliament became concerned that Charles might advance on London . John Venn took control of Windsor Castle with twelve companies of foot soldiers to protect the route along the Thames river , becoming the governor of the castle for the duration of the war . The contents of St George 's Chapel were both valuable and , to many Parliamentary forces , inappropriately high church in style . Looting began immediately : Edward IV 's bejewelled coat of mail was stolen ; the chapel 's organs , windows and books destroyed ; the Lady Chapel was emptied of valuables , including the component parts of Henry VIII 's unfinished tomb . By the end of the war , some 3580 oz ( 101 kg ) of gold and silver plate had been looted . </P>
<P> Prince Rupert of the Rhine , a prominent Royalist general , attempted to relieve Windsor Castle that November . Rupert 's small force of cavalry was able to take the town of Windsor , but was unable to overcome the walls at Windsor Castle -- in due course , Rupert was forced to retreat . Over the winter of 1642 -- 3 , Windsor Castle was converted into the headquarters for the Earl of Essex , a senior Parliamentary general . The Horseshoe Cloister was taken over as a prison for captured Royalists , and the resident canons were expelled from the castle . The Lady Chapel was turned into a magazine . Looting by the underpaid garrison continued to be a problem ; 500 royal deer were killed across the Windsor Great Park during the winter , and fences were burned as firewood . </P>
<P> In 1647 Charles , then a prisoner of Parliament , was brought to the castle for a period under arrest , before being moved to Hampton Court . In 1648 there was a Royalist plan , never enacted , to seize Windsor Castle . The Parliamentary Army Council moved into Windsor in November and decided to try Charles for treason . Charles was held at Windsor again for the last three weeks of his reign ; after his execution in January 1649 , his body was taken back to Windsor that night through a snowstorm , to be interred without ceremony in the vault beneath St George 's Chapel . </P>
<P> The Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 saw the first period of significant change to Windsor Castle for many years . The civil war and the years of the Interregnum had caused extensive damage to the royal palaces in England . At the same time the shifting `` functional requirements , patterns of movement , modes of transport , aesthetic taste and standards of comfort '' amongst royal circles was changing the qualities being sought in a successful palace . Windsor was the only royal palace to be successfully fully modernised by Charles II in the Restoration years . </P>
<P> During the Interregnum , however , squatters had occupied Windsor Castle . As a result , the `` King 's house was a wreck ; the fanatic , the pilferer , and the squatter , having been at work ... Paupers had squatted in many of the towers and cabinets '' . Shortly after returning to England , Charles appointed Prince Rupert , one of his few surviving close relatives , to be the Constable of Windsor Castle in 1668 . Rupert immediately began to reorder the castle 's defences , repairing the Round Tower and reconstructing the real tennis court . Charles attempted to restock Windsor Great Park with deer brought over from Germany , but the herds never recovered their pre-war size . Rupert created apartments for himself in the Round Tower , decorated with an `` extraordinary '' number of weapons and armour , with his inner chambers `` hung with tapisserie , curious and effeminate pictures '' . </P>
<P> Charles was heavily influenced by Louis XIV style and imitated French design at his palace at Winchester and the Royal Hospital at Chelsea . At Windsor , Charles created `` the most extravagantly Baroque interiors ever executed in England '' . Much of the building work was paid for out of increased royal revenues from Ireland during the 1670s . French court etiquette at the time required a substantial number of enfiladed rooms to satisfy court protocol ; the demand for space forced architect Hugh May to expand out into the North Terrace , rebuilding and widening it in the process . This new building was called the Star Building , because Charles II placed a huge gilt Garter star on the side of it . May took down and rebuilt the walls of Edward III 's hall and chapel , incorporating larger windows but retaining the height and dimensions of the medieval building . Although Windsor Castle was now big enough to hold the entire court , it was not built with chambers for the King 's Council , as would be found in Whitehall . Instead Charles took advantage of the good road links emerging around Windsor to hold his council meetings at Hampton Court when he was staying at the castle . The result became an `` exemplar '' for royal buildings for the next twenty - five years . The result of May 's work showed a medievalist leaning ; although sometimes criticised for its `` dullness '' , May 's reconstruction was both sympathetic to the existing castle and a deliberate attempt to create a slightly austere 17th - century version of a `` neo-Norman '' castle . </P>
<P> William III commissioned Nicholas Hawksmoor and Sir Christopher Wren to conduct a large , final classical remodelling of the Upper Ward , but the king 's early death caused the plan to be cancelled . Queen Anne was fond of the castle , and attempted to address the lack of a formal garden by instructing Henry Wise to begin work on the Maestricht Garden beneath the North Terrace , which was never completed . Anne also created the racecourse at Ascot and began the tradition of the annual Royal Ascot procession from the castle . </P>
<P> George I took little interest in Windsor Castle , preferring his other palaces at St James 's , Hampton Court and Kensington . George II rarely used Windsor either , preferring Hampton Court . Many of the apartments in the Upper Ward were given out as `` grace and favour '' privileges for the use of prominent widows or other friends of the Crown . The Duke of Cumberland made the most use of the property in his role as the Ranger of Windsor Great Park . By the 1740s , Windsor Castle had become an early tourist attraction ; wealthier visitors who could afford to pay the castle keeper could enter , see curiosities such as the castle 's narwhal horn , and by the 1750s buy the first guidebooks to Windsor , produced by George Bickham in 1753 and Joseph Pote in 1755 . As the condition of the State Apartments continued to deteriorate , even the general public were able to regularly visit the property . </P>
<P> George III reversed this trend when he came to the throne in 1760 . George disliked Hampton Court , and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle . George wanted to move into the Ranger 's House by the castle , but his brother , Henry was already living in it and refused to move out . Instead , George had to move into the Upper Lodge , later called the Queen 's Lodge , and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks . Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal , with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards , and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds . As time went by , however , access for visitors became more limited . </P>
<P> George 's architectural taste shifted over the years . As a young man , he favoured Classical , in particular Palladian styles , but the king came to favour a more Gothic style , both as a consequence of the Palladian style becoming overused and poorly implemented , and because the Gothic form had come to be seen as a more honest , national style of English design in the light of the French revolution . Working with the architect James Wyatt , George attempted to `` transform the exterior of the buildings in the Upper Ward into a Gothic palace , while retaining the character of the Hugh May state rooms '' . The outside of the building was restyled with Gothic features , including new battlements and turrets . Inside , conservation work was undertaken , and several new rooms constructed , including a new Gothic staircase to replace May 's 17th - century version , complete with the Grand Vestibule ceiling above it . New paintings were purchased for the castle , and collections from other royal palaces moved there by the king . The cost of the work came to over £ 150,000 ( £ 100 million in 2008 terms ) . The king undertook extensive work in the castle 's Great Park as well , laying out the new Norfolk and Flemish farms , creating two dairies and restoring Virginia Water Lake , and its grotto and follies . </P>
<P> At the end of this period Windsor Castle became a place of royal confinement . In 1788 the king first became ill during a dinner at Windsor Castle ; diagnosed as suffering from madness , he was removed for a period to the White House at Kew , where he temporarily recovered . After relapses in 1801 and 1804 , his condition became enduring from 1810 onwards and he was confined in the State Apartments of Windsor Castle , with building work on the castle ceasing the following year . </P>
<P> George IV came to the throne in 1820 intending to create a set of royal palaces that reflected his wealth and influence as the ruler of an increasingly powerful Britain . George 's previous houses , Carlton House and the Brighton Pavilion were too small for grand court events , even after expensive extensions . George expanded the Royal Lodge in the castle park whilst he was Prince Regent , and then began a programme of work to modernise the castle itself once he became king . </P>
<P> George persuaded Parliament to vote him £ 300,000 for restoration ( £ 245 million in 2008 terms ) . Under the guidance of George 's advisor , Charles Long , the architect Jeffry Wyatville was selected , and work commenced in 1824 . Wyatville 's own preference ran to Gothic architecture , but George , who had led the reintroduction of the French Rococo style to England at Carlton House , preferred a blend of periods and styles , and applied this taste to Windsor . The terraces were closed off to visitors for greater privacy and the exterior of the Upper Ward was completely remodelled into its current appearance . The Round Tower was raised in height to create a more dramatic appearance ; many of the rooms in the State Apartments were rebuilt or remodelled ; numerous new towers were created , much higher than the older versions . The south range of the ward was rebuilt to provide private accommodation for the king , away from the state rooms . The statue of Charles II was moved from the centre of the Upper Ward to the base of the motte . Sir Walter Scott captured contemporary views when he noted that the work showed `` a great deal of taste and feeling for the Gothic architecture '' ; many modern commentators , including Prince Charles , have criticised Wyatville 's work as representing an act of vandalism of May 's earlier designs . The work was unfinished at the time of George IV 's death in 1830 , but was broadly completed by Wyatville 's death in 1840 . The total expenditure on the castle had soared to the colossal sum of over one million pounds ( £ 817 million in 2008 terms ) by the end of the project . </P>
<P> Queen Victoria and Prince Albert made Windsor Castle their principal royal residence , despite Victoria complaining early in her reign that the castle was `` dull and tiresome '' and `` prison - like '' , and preferring Osborne and Balmoral as holiday residences . The growth of the British Empire and Victoria 's close dynastic ties to Europe made Windsor the hub for many diplomatic and state visits , assisted by the new railways and steamships of the period . Indeed , it has been argued that Windsor reached its social peak during the Victorian era , seeing the introduction of invitations to numerous prominent figures to `` dine and sleep '' at the castle . Victoria took a close interest in the details of how Windsor Castle was run , including the minutiae of the social events . Few visitors found these occasions comfortable , both due to the design of the castle and the excessive royal formality . Prince Albert died in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle in 1861 and was buried in the Royal Mausoleum built at nearby Frogmore , within the Home Park . The prince 's rooms were maintained exactly as they had been at the moment of his death and Victoria kept the castle in a state of mourning for many years , becoming known as the `` Widow of Windsor '' , a phrase popularised in the famous poem by Rudyard Kipling . The Queen shunned the use of Buckingham Palace after Albert 's death and instead used Windsor Castle as her residence when conducting official business near London . Towards the end of her reign , plays , operas , and other entertainments slowly began to be held at the castle again , accommodating both the Queen 's desire for entertainment and her reluctance to be seen in public . </P>
<P> Several minor alterations were made to the Upper Ward under Victoria . Anthony Salvin rebuilt Wyatville 's grand staircase , with Edward Blore constructing a new private chapel within the State Apartments . Salvin also rebuilt the State Dining Room following a serious fire in 1853 . Ludwig Gruner assisted in the design of the Queen 's Private Audience Chamber in the south range . Blore and Salvin also did extensive work in the Lower Ward , under the direction of Prince Albert , including the Hundred Steps leading down into Windsor town , rebuilding the Garter , Curfew and Salisbury towers , the houses of the Military Knights and creating a new Guardhouse . George Gilbert Scott rebuilt the Horseshoe Cloister in the 1870s . The Norman Gatehouse was turned into a private dwelling for Sir Henry Ponsonby . Windsor Castle did not benefit from many of the minor improvements of the era , however , as Victoria disliked gaslight , preferring candles ; electric lighting was only installed in limited parts of the castle at the end of her reign . Indeed , the castle was famously cold and draughty in Victoria 's reign , but it was connected to a nearby reservoir , with water reliably piped into the interior for the first time . </P>
<P> Many of the changes under Victoria were to the surrounding parklands and buildings . The Royal Dairy at Frogmore was rebuilt in a Tudorbethan style in 1853 ; George III 's Dairy rebuilt in a Renaissance style in 1859 ; the Georgian Flemish Farm rebuilt , and the Norfolk Farm renovated . The Long Walk was planted with fresh trees to replace the diseased stock . The Windsor Castle and Town Approaches Act , passed by Parliament in 1848 , permitted the closing and re-routing of the old roads which previously ran through the park from Windsor to Datchet and Old Windsor . These changes allowed the Royal Family to undertake the enclosure of a large area of parkland to form the private `` Home Park '' with no public roads passing through it . The Queen granted additional rights for public access to the remainder of the park as part of this arrangement . </P>
<P> Edward VII came to the throne in 1901 and immediately set about modernising Windsor Castle with `` enthusiasm and zest '' . Many of the rooms in the Upper Ward were de-cluttered and redecorated for the first time in many years , with Edward `` peering into cabinets ; ransacking drawers ; clearing rooms formerly used by the Prince Consort and not touched since his death ; dispatching case - loads of relics and ornaments to a special room in the Round Tower ... destroying statues and busts of John Brown ... throwing out hundreds of ' rubbishy old coloured photographs ' ... ( and ) rearranging pictures '' . Electric lighting was added to more rooms , along with central heating ; telephone lines were installed , along with garages for the newly invented automobiles . The marathon was run from Windsor Castle at the 1908 Olympics , and in 1911 the pioneering aviator Thomas Sopwith landed an aircraft at the castle for the first time . </P>
<P> George V continued a process of more gradual modernisation , assisted by his wife , Mary of Teck , who had a strong interest in furniture and decoration . Mary sought out and re-acquired items of furniture that had been lost or sold from the castle , including many dispersed by Edward VII , and also acquired many new works of art to furnish the state rooms . Queen Mary was also a lover of all things miniature , and a famous dolls ' house was created for her at Windsor Castle , designed by the architect Edwin Lutyens and furnished by leading craftsmen and designers of the 1930s . George V was committed to maintaining a high standard of court life at Windsor Castle , adopting the motto that everything was to be `` of the best '' . A large staff was still kept at the castle , with around 660 servants working in the property during the period . Meanwhile , during the First World War , anti-German feeling led the members of the Royal Family to change their dynastic name from the German House of Saxe - Coburg and Gotha ; George decided to take the new name from the castle , and the Royal Family became the House of Windsor in 1917 . </P>
<P> Edward VIII did not spend much of his reign at Windsor Castle . He continued to spend most of his time at Fort Belvedere in the Great Park , where he had lived whilst Prince of Wales . Edward created a small aerodrome at the castle on Smith 's Lawn , now used as a golf - course . Edward 's reign was short - lived and he broadcast his abdication speech to the British Empire from the castle in December 1936 , adopting the title of Duke of Windsor . His successor , George VI also preferred his own original home , the Royal Lodge in the Great Park , but moved into Windsor Castle with his wife Elizabeth . As king , George revived the annual Garter Service at Windsor , drawing on the accounts of the 17th - century ceremonies recorded by Elias Ashmole , but moving the event to Ascot Week in June . </P>
<P> On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 the castle was readied for war - time conditions . Many of the staff from Buckingham Palace were moved to Windsor for safety , security was tightened and windows were blacked - out . There was significant concern that the castle might be damaged or destroyed during the war ; the more important art works were removed from the castle for safe - keeping , the valuable chandeliers were lowered to the floor in case of bomb damage and a sequence of paintings by John Piper were commissioned from 1942 -- 4 to record the castle 's appearance . The king and queen and their children Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret lived for safety in the castle , with the roof above their rooms specially strengthened in case of attack . The king and queen drove daily to London , returning to Windsor to sleep , although at the time this was a well - kept secret , as for propaganda and morale purposes it was reported that the king was still residing full - time at Buckingham Palace . The castle was also used as a storage facility ; for example , the only purified heavy water at the time was rescued from France in the face of the imminent French defeat in 1940 , and most of it was sent to the castle to be stored in the basement alongside the Crown Jewels . After the war the king revived the `` dine and sleep '' events at Windsor , following comments that the castle had become `` almost like a vast , empty museum '' ; nonetheless , it took many years to restore Windsor Castle to its pre-war condition . </P>
<P> In February 1952 , Elizabeth II came to the throne and decided to make Windsor her principal weekend retreat . The private apartments which had not been properly occupied since the era of Queen Mary were renovated and further modernised , and the Queen , Prince Philip and their two children took up residence . By the early 1990s , however , there had been a marked deterioration in the quality of the Upper Ward , in particular the State Apartments . Generations of repairs and replacements had resulted in a `` diminution of the richness with which they had first been decorated '' , a `` gradual attrition of the original vibrancy of effect , as each change repeated a more faded version of the last '' . A programme of repair work to replace the heating and the wiring of the Upper Ward began in 1988 . Work was also undertaken to underpin the motte of the Round Tower after fresh subsidence was detected in 1988 , threatening the collapse of the tower . </P>
<P> On 20 November 1992 , a major fire occurred at Windsor Castle , lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread damage to the Upper Ward . The Private Chapel in the north - east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated as part of a long term programme of work within the castle , and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning . The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms , and severely damaged more than 100 others . Fire - fighters applied water to contain the blaze , whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle . Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work , and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection . The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze , at great risk to the 200 fire - fighters involved . It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control , although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning . Along with the fire and smoke damage , one of the unintended effects of the fire - fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle ; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it , which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire . </P>
<P> Two major issues for Windsor Castle emerged following the fire . The first was a political debate in Britain as to who should pay for the repairs . Traditionally , as the property of the Crown , Windsor Castle was maintained , and if necessary repaired , by the British government in exchange for the profits made by the Crown Estate . Furthermore , like other occupied royal palaces , it was not insured on grounds of economy . At the time of the fire , however , the British press strongly argued in favour of the Queen herself being required to pay for the repairs from her private income . A solution was found in which the restoration work would be paid for by opening Buckingham Palace to the public at selected times of the year , and by introducing new charges for public access to the parkland surrounding Windsor . The second major issue concerned how to repair the castle . Some suggested that the damaged rooms should be restored to their original appearance , but others favoured repairing the castle so as to incorporate modern designs . The decision was taken to largely follow the pre-fire architecture with some changes to reflect modern tastes and cost , but fresh questions emerged over whether the restoration should be undertaken to `` authentic '' or `` equivalent '' restoration standards . Modern methods were used at Windsor to reproduce the equivalent pre-fire appearance , partially due to the cost . The restoration programme was completed in 1997 at a total cost of £ 37 million ( £ 67 million in 2015 terms ) . </P>
<P> During the Queen 's tenure much has been done , not only to restore and maintain the fabric of the building , but also to transform it into a major British tourist attraction , containing a significant portion of the Royal Collection of art , which is managed from Windsor . Archaeological work has continued at the castle , following on from limited investigations in the 1970s , the work on the Round Tower from 1988 -- 92 and the investigations following the 1992 fire . During 2007 , 993,000 tourists visited the castle . This has had to be achieved in co-ordination with security issues and the castle 's role as a working royal palace . In late 2011 two large water turbines were installed upstream of the castle on the River Thames to provide hydroelectric power to the castle and the surrounding estate . In April 2016 it was announced that the Royal Collection Trust is to fund a £ 27m project that will reinstate the original entrance hall of the castle to visitors , as well as a new cafe that will be housed in the 14th Century undercroft . The project is scheduled for completion at the end of 2018 , and will include a visitor centre and a dedicated learning centre . </P>
<P> Windsor Castle , part of the Occupied Royal Palaces Estate , is owned by Queen Elizabeth II in right of the Crown , and day - to - day management is by the Royal Household . In terms of population , Windsor Castle is the largest inhabited castle in the world and the longest - occupied palace in Europe , but it also remains a functioning royal home . As of 2006 , around 500 people were living and working in the castle . The Queen has increasingly used the castle as a royal palace as well as her weekend home and it is now as often used for state banquets and official entertaining as Buckingham Palace . In recent years , Windsor Castle has hosted visits from President Mbeki of South Africa , King Abdullah II of Jordan and President Obama of the United States . The castle remains an important ceremonial location . The Waterloo ceremony is carried out in the presence of the Queen each year , and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in St George 's Chapel . While the Queen is in residence , the Guard Mounting ceremony occurs on a daily basis . The Royal Ascot procession leaves the castle each year during the annual meeting . </P>
